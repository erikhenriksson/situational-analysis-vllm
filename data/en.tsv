IN ra	Bringing Down the Barriers: The Labour Market and Women with Disabilities in Ontario by Gail Fawcett Section 3: Social attitudes Focus group participants in all groups mentioned negative social attitudes and lack of public awareness as two of the top three barriers that they faced when trying to enter or stay in the paid labour market. The problem begins with a lack of awareness about disabilities and disability issues. One factor that was brought up repeatedly was the negative impact of highly visible disabilities. Some participants noted that people often have a fear of being around persons with highly visible disabilities. "People just don?t want to look at us. They don?t want us around as reminders that this could be them at some point in the future." As well, some highly visible disabilities can mask the true potential and capabilities of persons with disabilities. As a result, negative judgements are placed upon individuals because their speech or appearance is not "normal." "People think I?m drunk because of the way my eyes look." "People look at my disability and they hear my speech. I can?t leave those things in the waiting room when I go for an interview. Whenever I have actually got a job, I always had positive feedback. But they were all short-term jobs. Attitude is my biggest barrier." Women with learning disabilities commented that they were typically treated like children and not given credit when they had performed well on the job because attitudes in their workplace were such that no one believed that they could have actually done the job on their own. "When people asked: ?Did you do that? Who helped you?? It really hurt. You wonder if you should tell anyone that you have a learning disability. If they know, they might be able to give you the supports on the job. But if you do tell them, they never take your abilities seriously again." Women with developmental disabilities face enormous attitudinal barriers. They also feel that they are "treated like children" or aren?t "trusted." However, when given the opportunity and the right job, these women are quite capable of working in the paid labour market and living independently. "I used to work in a sheltered workshop. I never thought I would ever have a real job. Then I began what was supposed to be a two-month contract. But they renewed and renewed ? it?s nine years later and I?m still employed." Those who don?t have a visible disability also experience negative attitudes. When it came to matters involving the labour market and social services, many of the focus group participants voiced the belief that while social attitudes toward persons with disabilities improved over the 1980s, they have deteriorated over the course of the 1990s. "It breaks my heart that society has devolved into a very hateful society. I?m concerned about the future for all of us." "When employment gets tight, prejudices surface." Women in our focus groups also noted that public attitudes and their own situation had an impact on their self-esteem. This can often lead to low self-esteem, lack of confidence and poor performance in job interviews. "I had to fight to get homecare to come in twice a week to help me have a bath. Do you know what it?s like going for a job interview a few days after your last bath?" While both women and men with disabilities face these attitudinal barriers, women also fight gender bias. Although women with disabilities have a high degree of financial responsibility within their households, they report that employers often still believe that they are being taken care of by someone else and don?t really need to work for pay. Sexism interacts with disability in other ways. One woman who required a special seat to sit in her wheelchair had her request to a local service club turned down because "they said that they only provide assistance to men." Visible minority women with disabilities often feel that they have an additional mark against them. Several in our focus groups mentioned that they felt racial discrimination compounded the challenges of being female and having a disability. However, they were reluctant to attribute past negative experiences solely to racial discrimination. Some felt that they had so many factors working against them that they couldn?t be sure how much of their situation could be attributed to their race. "Is it because of my language, my race, my disability, or because I?m a woman? Why am I not being hired?" One of the most illustrative examples of the complex interplay of attitudes toward race, disability, and gender can be found in ERDCO?s 1996 study, entitled Including Us . . . Ethno Racial People with Disabilities speak out on issues of race and disability : One woman?s horrifying story illustrates the multiple oppressions which women are often subjected to. As a Muslim woman, she adhered to certain norms of modesty and covered her hair. Some of her female co-workers wanted to see her without her hijab (head covering) and she showed them a picture of herself which she carried in her purse. Her co-workers later took the picture out of her bag and photocopied it on top a likeness of a naked woman. They wrote "I love sex" on the picture and stuck it on the back of her wheelchair. The woman spent part of the day moving about in a public space and no one warned her of its existence. It was only when she was going home that someone told her about the picture. "I felt humiliated. They tormented me as a minority woman, they violated my religious beliefs and they mocked my disability. Through this single obscene act they managed to attack me on several levels." 34 Finally, focus group participants called for more public education regarding disability. By increasing awareness and understanding of disability, it is hoped that other, more tangible, barriers might fall. Attitudes and awareness were mentioned in almost every focus group as an area needing improvement: "Attitude is the biggest barrier. People have to be retrained to know that we have grown with the times and that we can do things." "Just to show you what we?re up against, a dear friend of mine who is blind went to a restaurant with a group of people, and the maitre d? asked: ?Smoking section or non-smoking section?? She answered: ?Non-smoking please.? He then asked: ?What about the (guide) dog?? She answered: ?Oh, I guess you could put him in the smoking section!? "

NA	"The UX of publishing for tablets and smartphones" - Martin Belam at #TAS12 This is an essay version of a talk I gave at the Tablet & App Summit at the World Publishing Expo in Frankfurt, October 2012. For nearly all of my adult digital life, people have been telling me that next year is going to be the big breakthrough year for the mobile web. One year I got so excited about this that I even taught myself WML - a mark-up language somewhere between HTML and 1960s computer punch-cards. I thought I was going to be the most employable developer in town. I worked for the BBC at the time , but on my Sony Ericsson T-610 it took ages to navigate through the real mobile site to the sections I knew I wanted to read. I wrote a script that took RSS feeds from some BBC Sport sections I was interested in, and then published the headlines and links out as a WML page. Data cost money, and bandwidth was low, so having a simple overview of the news I wanted to see as I headed off to work in the morning was an attractive proposition. I was in a hurry. I was on a bus. I only wanted to scan headlines and snack on information. I was a walking talking mobile use case clich This was in June 2004, and the Olympics were being held in Athens . This is so long ago that, in those days, the IOC asked that you send a fax to their lawyers requesting permission before you linked to their website. The award of the 2012 Olympic Games to London was still a year away. By the time they came around this year, it felt like we had finally reached a significant tipping point with mobile. After the Games finished, new media chief for London 2012 Alex Balfour published an analysis of usage of london2012.com during the event. One very telling statistic was that 60% of visits to the site during the course of the Olympics were from a mobile or tablet device . The fact is that people love their touchscreen devices. I've seen a survey suggesting that most Europeans are never more than a metre from their phones -- i.e. they carry them around with them all day, then put them down beside them at their bedside when they sleep. You know, in case they need to check their text messages at 4am. And we are now conditioned to expect touch. I keep making myself look ridiculous trying to buy tickets on various European urban transport systems by resolutely stabbing my fingers at some screen whilst ignoring the perfectly obvious buttons located next to it. Touchscreen apps at the Guardian Over the course of my time at the Guardian I worked on several apps aimed at touchscreen devices, including the first Guardian iPhone app. A small team worked hard to bring a version of the Guardian to the phone that felt more naturally designed for the device, and to give a better user experience than the standard free mobile site. The app originally had a one-off download charge. Prior to launch, a lot of the wisdom in the market was that you couldn't charge for general purpose news apps -- and you certainly couldn't charge for them if all of the content was available for free via the web browser on the same phone. That "wisdom" was wrong, and the app was a success, to the extent that when we were running user testing sessions prior to developing version two, our own users were telling us that it was too cheap, and that they would have happily paid a subscription. User testing was an important part of ensuring that the product met the needs of users, and that the design and functionality are easily understood. The Guardian iPhone app I also worked on testing for the Guardian iPad edition. I think it is a beautifully designed reading experience on the device , but that doesn't seem to have translated to mass take-up of the app. User testing prior to release showed up some flaws in the product proposition for the early adopter techie crowd -- at the time of launch I described the testing on this blog as "showing a family saloon to some boy racers. They would grudgingly admit that it had four wheels and got you from A to B, but they weren't excited about it, and didn't find it digital enough." On that occasion, the business opted to take small details from the user testing sessions -- for example adding tiny chevrons on every article to indicate that you can swipe from left to right -- but not to fundamentally alter the static edition-based premise of the Guardian on iPad that many users were finding unsatisfactory. The Guardian iPad app features little chevrons to indicate where the user can swipe We need to really understand our users, not just second-guess them. If you've never had the opportunity to observe a user testing session, I urge you to do so. Watching someone struggle to use the simplest of products you've had a hand in building reminds you that perfectly formed designs don't just fall out of your head. And people aren't always running for buses or sitting on trains when using their smartphones or tablets. The idea that because a device is mobile it is always used in a mobile context is a fallacy. At Google, Hendrik Mller, Jennifer Gove and John Webb recently published a research paper describing a study into tablet usage in the US . They did a combination of "diary study, interview, and observational methods" with 33 participants, who were chosen to align to the general demographics of tablet ownership in the US. One of the most interesting findings is the verification that tablets are overwhelmingly used in the house, with the couch and the bed being the two most popular locations. The most popular activities by far are checking email, playing games, checking social networks and looking for information. A diagram from the research by Mller, Gove and Webb, showing the activity and location of use recorded by participants in the study. Notably, less instances of "Reading the news" were reported than instances of "light content creation" -- which given the presumption that tablets are a lean-back consumption device struck me as slightly unexpected. Patterns of usage change during the week: "Weekdays showed more frequent email checking, managing of calendars, and checking the weather, but also included longer activities such as listening to music or social networking; however, activities such as watching videos, playing games, reading, and shopping were more frequently done on weekends." Users are also frequently doing something else at the same time as using their tablet device: "41% [of uses of tablets reported in the study] showed partial engagement. Note that this number is to be considered as a lower bound as it is possible that participants under-reported or forgot to explain those activities they were engaged in outside their tablet use. The most frequently reported non-tablet activities that participants were doing at the same time they were using their tablet were: Watching TV, eating or drinking, cooking, waiting somewhere, getting dressed, talking with others, and exercising, among others." Do one thing, and do it well If users are trying to do two things at once, then the chances are that are not concentrating fully on either, which tends to suggest apps need a simplicity at their heart. In fact, I'll bet that the apps you use most on your phone or tablet do one thing, and do it very well. What do I mean by doing one thing only? Well, consider Microsoft Outlook on the desktop. It sends and receives emails. It manages your contacts and address book. It does meeting requests and calendar management. It has a task list functionality. And a very cluttered UI. Microsoft Outlook 2010 can look very cluttered on the desktop Contrast this with Apple's approach to similar features in iOS. Mail, Calendar and Contact management are in separate apps. The user chooses up front which aspect of their life they want to manage or edit, and so the small screen device is able to present a UI entirely attuned to what the user is trying to do at that moment . Not a route to everything they might possibly want to do that the device or software is capable of. Yet often publishers want apps that showcase the breadth and depth of everything that they do. At the Guardian it was sometimes possible to develop very simple apps. With the pressure of getting it ready in time for the launch of the original iPad, the Eyewitness app showed off beautiful photography beautifully. The original incarnation simply gave you one brilliant new photograph every day, with sponsorship as the business model. It wasn't always this focussed though. The beta version of a Guardian app built for Google TV devices ended up featuring lots of different content types, even though TV as a medium would typically have suggested video and photo galleries should be the priority. In fact valuable development and design time was spent on formatting text articles for the TV, when in reality, the chances seem slim that an early adopter of internet-enabled television would not also have a more convenient device to hand to read the news. How do you apply this thinking to your products? Ruthlessly prioritise your use cases, and find ways to put users onto these simplified paths as soon as possible. One of the exercises in my "Responsive IA" workshop typically looks at hotel websites. They need to support a complex array of use cases -- researching a trip, booking a room, getting to a venue, selling the hotel as a venue for conferences and weddings etc. But it strikes me that there is one key pivot point amongst those multiple audiences, namely "Do you already have a booking with this hotel or not?" If I was designing a hotel website for small screen devices, the first thing I'd test would be whether having a big button that takes users with existing bookings off to a whole separate information architecture that supports their needs worked. A sketch of trying to split the user journey at the earliest opportunity on a hotel website And if making that journey easier works for the smallest screen, why wouldn't you use the same approach on tablets and desktop machines too? Should that design translate back to the big screen version? The challenge of "responsive design" The trend towards responsive design in digital services presents some big workflow challenges for both publishers and designers. "The ads had the most restrictions and required the highest level of functionality on the site redesign. The ads themselves would remain at fixed sizes, but the page would need to load the correct ad for the device type (mobile, tablet, desktop) as well as one that fitted in the available size. When orientation changes occur (users rotate their mobile devices or tablets) or the browser window width changed, some of the ads that fit previously would no longer fit on the page without breaking the layout." If I can get away with it, I've been tending to design the minimum number of screen possible. This isn't just a case of being lazy. It strikes me that we didn't used to make different design deliverables for people on tiny monitors or on large monitors, so you should only be making designs for the sizes where things actually need to vary. In that AppendTo() case study, they mention Time supplying them with over 200 Photoshop files of how the redesign was destined to look. That sounds like an absolute nightmare. They stressed that the only way they made the project work was because Time gave them permission to make local decisions every time they had to vary from the comps, without having to refer back to the Time design team. We need to change the way we work though. If you make 200 photoshop illustrations, all you've done is draw some pictures. You haven't written a single line of code that will get you to the end of a project any faster. Obviously you need to use the right tools for the job, and code isn't the right medium to do all of your design work in, but rapid prototyping feels like it is going to be the only sustainable way to produce responsive designs on a grand scale. The still below is from a video about the Boston Globe's responsive redesign, and it shows their testing rig -- lots and lots of devices with varying screen sizes, stuck to the wall in various orientations, all set up to show exactly the same page from the site at the same time. With this kind of test bench, and designing in code, you can immediately see the effect of changes across multiple devices and breakpoints in a way that would take hours to replicate in InDesign or Illustrator or Photoshop. The Boston Globe's testing rig for their responsive design Don't forget production staff You shouldn't forget your content production staff either. We talk about end users loving their touchscreen devices, phones and tablets, but so do the staff at publishing houses. At the Guardian I always used to argue that from a standing start I could beat any journalist in publishing to the web. Whilst I was using the Tumblr app on my iPhone, they'd be struggling with their laptop, VPN and authenticating through the remote version of the CMS. Now speed isn't everything -- accuracy is one of the ways that news organisations can distinguish themselves from the herd -- but sometimes it is. In fact, for fashion shows, we ended up equipping the journalists with phones and Tumblr, and built a system to republish the Tumblr content on guardian.co.uk. If your staff are consistently getting a great, flexible, mobile user experience from the tools they use to publish in their spare time, a clunky desktop-bound enterprise CMS is going to look increasingly outdated to them. The Guardian's Fashion Tumblr circumvents CMS limitations. Know your devices You really need to know your devices as well. Managers who are addicted to their BlackBerrys and designers who idolise Apple are not in the best position to judge whether something feels native on an Android device or Windows tablet. When working on projects for different platforms, I always tried to use one of the devices as my main phone for a few weeks, to really get a feel for how it operates. Little details like the placement of search icons or how social media sharing is integrated vary from platform to platform, and you want the audience to feel like your app or service has been built for them and for their device . People talk about wanting to get a consistent user experience across a portfolio of apps and services. The user, in most cases, is likely to only use one or two of those platforms. The overlap between people owning iOS, Android and Windows Phones has got to be small. The much more important consistent user experience for the customer is that all the apps on their phone or tablet behave in the way they would expect them to on that device . Look beyond your traditional competitors In the news and media industry we still tend to compare ourselves to our narrow historical competitor set. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the UK's ABCe figures which audit "newspaper" website figures. It provides a league table of websites owned by people who also own printing presses, not a league table of news sites. Major players in the online news market like the BBC and Sky News aren't represented, not are destinations like MSN and Yahoo!. Despite being considered unsexy, and not particularly known for being news providers, their news services rack up millions and millions of page views. "The problem is, Singapore and Canada, or the United States, or the UK for that matter, are not competitors when delivering online experiences to their citizens. Canadians don't compare the (terrible) online experience they get with the government to that of Singapore, or Sweden. Rather they compare their experience to Facebook, to HipMunk, to Gmail and Flickr. All the Accenture report did was take a group of laggards who generally deliver a crappy online experience, lump them together and rank them. Rather than tell governments their online performance was in crisis, it reassured them that all was well." As an industry, this is what we do to ourselves when we declare "newspaper" websites to be something distinct and apart from the rest of the news sources on the web, or when we only judge the user experience of our tablet apps by comparing them to other magazines or publishers. You probably don't need a "mobile strategy" or "tablet strategy" There is a recurring internet meme of Russian Reversal jokes. You know the kind, based on Yakov Smirnoff's comedy routines from the 1980s: -- "In America, you can always find a party. In Soviet Russia, Party always find you!" or "In America, you listen to man on radio. In Soviet Russia, man on radio listen to you!" I think a kind of reversal is happening to our industry. You might be sitting around debating whether your business needs to have a "mobile strategy" or a "tablet strategy". You might be pondering whether you should declare that you are "digital first" or "mobile first". You might be worrying about competitors who are pure digital plays without any of the legacy costs of owning a print operation You can debate all these things for as long as you want, but your audience has already chosen for you. They've already gone "mobile first". You probably need to start playing catch up. The original slides for this presentation featured three photos of elementary students using iPads at school to do amazing projects, taken by Lexie Flickinger, and re-used via Flickr and a Creative Commons Licence.

OP	What Makes You Look at It? December 22, 2008 I love lists of good content. Don't we all - the internet is a Niagara Falls of content, so a list helps you find the good stuff. Despite the lists, I run across dozens of things each week that I really want to read, but don't have time to, or don't get around to. Partly this is because they're too long. I want short content! Interesting, funny, provoking ... efficient. However, I've noticed lately there are several such things - short bits of interesting content - that I want to engage, but never do. (For example: several awesome podcasts, Seth Godin's blog, Daily News from Good.is) Why don't I take the time to engage in this awesome content that I really like (and know I really like) especially after the producer has taken the time to package it well and make it short and good? Do you have this problem? What do content producer's need to do to make me engage their content?

NA	BNSW seeing what they want to see ? Bicycle NSW member Martin Stock is on the ground in London working for Channel Nine on the Olympic boradcast. He was kind enough to email us some details of his experiences in the city that all the world is watching... No photo tonight but instead, an observation... After a very long and stressful nine hours on air I got back to my hotel room. I switched on the TV and and heard the BBC news headline stories which included, among many other Olympic headlines, the predicted transport nightmares did not materialise on the first day of events clashing with a normal business day. Amazingly, they included two sound bytes - the first from the British Prime Minister who caught the Tube to work and, secondly, the (admittedly nutty, promoter of the free bike scheme) London Mayor, typically dishevelled and wearing a bike helmet, who rode his bike to work. I was astounded that the two most powerful people in the City/Country didn't just talk about it: they walked (/rode the bike and train) the walk. I know that Sydney had a great outcome with transport during the Olympics, but I was really impressed with the politicians here. They have really followed through with the message even in a city that relies so heavily on their non-car transport system as they do here. I appreciated it and I suppose it was something that I hope we should all appreciate and aspire to. 'Nuff said. Anyway, another early start, off to bed. P.S. The car drivers and cyclists get on so well here - it's amazing and heartening to watch. P.P.S. Having said all this I still hate having to catch the hot, crowded and cramped Tube in peak hour... The special Olympic media transport busses are much more comfortable and direct for our needs! My point is in this person entire observation/experience , he didn't make the observation that the helmet use was discretionary (as you can see from the cyclists streaming  past on the rowing competitions) " London Mayor, typically dishevelled and choosing/opting to wear a bike helmet, who rode his bike to work"  would be a far more accurate observation, don't you think ?"
OP rv	A common prejudice about Seb Coe is that he was a brilliant Olympian who morphed into a Tory Boy, sucking up to power. This autobiography affirms him as a man of the people rather than a son of privilege. No living Briton has covered so much social ground, from runner-geek to Conservative apparatchik to messianic transformer of London at the triumphant 2012 Games. By any measure, Coe's life is cinematic. London 2012 was not his work alone, but he was its guiding spirit. It provided the political stage denied to him by the grubbiness of Westminster and the shambles of William Hague-era Conservatism If the reader risks backache picking up all the names Coe drops, it is because he has always gravitated towards high office. His apparent poshness is an illusion. In a passage probably designed to correct a myth or two, Coe describes his grandmother Violet as "a true cockney" and great-grandfather Harry Newbold as a professional gambler. His father, Peter, who oversaw his athletic rise, was a communist sympathiser who joined the Merchant Navy to avoid swearing allegiance to the Crown. When Coe failed the 11-plus, Peter declined to spoon out fees and sent him to Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern in Warwickshire. Coe writes: "If I had ended up at a third-rate public school I would never have gone on to do what I've done." His battle against the elements after the family moved to Sheffield is rousing and atmospheric. His own Olympic flame was ignited by David Hemery winning gold and Sheffield's John Sherwood taking bronze in the 400m hurdles at Mexico in 1968. At Sherwood's homecoming, Coe thought: "That could be me." Related Articles He found his vital athletic counterpoint in Steve Ovett, who upset the odds by winning 800m gold in Moscow: a defeat Coe avenged in the 1500m. "The truth is that for one of the very few occasions in my life, I was afraid," Coe writes of the Moscow 800m. The win that followed was his great catharsis. Early political awareness was expressed in a boyhood scrapbook of newspaper cuttings. He was radicalised by the three-day week of the Seventies and what he calls the "drudgery of municipal socialism" in Sheffield, yet sympathised with the striking miners, on whose union tracks he had run: "I remember being at a party once, full of just the kind of braying Sloanes I loathed. The conversation turned to how great it was watching the miners getting hammered every night on the news. 'You have no idea what life in these communities is like, have you? No idea.' And I left." These egalitarian instincts underpinned his Olympic mission. They also lent him common cause with Hague, who made him his chief of staff and judo partner. "We were hewn from the same South Yorkshire landscape," Coe explains. He is a good anecdotalist. The best of his political yarns is his long war against a red-top "Krusty the Clown" (from The Simpsons ) who had been stalking Hague at photo-ops. The pair finished up wrestling on the ground at a seaside resort. Krusty finally gasped: "OK, That's it. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not paid enough." An extra-marital affair is confessed to and Coe is unbeatable on the dark politics of bidding. Much chortling has accompanied the revelation that Cherie Blair rounded on Jacques Chirac for his dismissive comment about British cooking. "She was at him like a banshee and he couldn't get out of that building fast enough," Coe writes. Her husband tells him: "The thing about my wife is that when she says something, she really means it." In the doomed 2018 World Cup bidding race, Fifa's president Sepp Blatter instructs our author: "Your game is run by idiots." Without Coe there would have been no London 2012. His marshalling of the bid was decisive and his political nous cleared a path through the thickets of media negativity. In his closing speech he cited a consultant anaesthetist at St Mary's Paddington who had worked on the night of the 7/7 bombings as well as at the Games. He told Coe: "For me this is closure. I have seen the worst of mankind and now I've seen the best of mankind." The teller of this tale had climbed his political Olympus.
NA	"I'll tell you something about being a composer and having the sort of education where creativity didn't belong. In art lessons the teacher would tell us to divide the paper up into squares and then fill them in with certain colours. Only there were some colours, red and yellow for instance, that weren't allowed to go next to each other, and nobody ever told me why. We were also told to do a silhouette of a town by putting a wash of blue then a wash of yellow, then a wash of red, and then you inked the rest in, and every single person in the class did the same thing. There was a sense of frustration there, no question of knowing what creativity was, or that it even existed. But when you are a kid you think that's the way the world is. I had a chest of music I'd written from the age of nine, but that was a private world of writing that no one was interested in. Music was something that composers in the past did; it was a mysterious thing and slightly holy in a way, something you don't tamper with. It took me a long time to realise that I could continue doing this myself, that maybe this was something that I could really develop and make into something quite important, for me. I was brought up to be a musician, but the thing about being a performer is that creativity never comes into it. Performing is something that can be taught. The people who play in an orchestra are middlemen. I wouldn't use the word "mere" performers, but it's not the same relationship with the material - theirs is an interpretive thing, and for me, whatever I've done, there's always been this creative aspect. But I come from what used to be called a working-class background, and working-class backgrounds are all concerned with guilt and how you are going to earn your living. So I had the clarinet; that had been given to me, and that was my career. I wasn't the least bit interested in it, I wasn't good enough at it - I would have been a fairly reasonable second- rate orchestral player, I reckon. But I wasn't in a position to say "I want to be a composer" when I became a music student, because you couldn't earn your living doing that; it wasn't what people did. Consequently, when I went to music school there was a real problem. I felt very much at odds because when I was writing music I was thinking maybe I should be practising, and when I was practising I thought there were more interesting things to do. I closed in on myself so far as my composition was concerned. My student persona was of a rather irresponsible wind player - I just don't think I was a very good student. My heart wasn't in playing the clarinet, and I had also decided that, in a sense, my student life was a waste of time. I was neither one thing nor the other; I hadn't made the big decision, and I didn't really write any music for five years. But that period when I wasn't writing wasn't barren. I didn't have writer's block. It was a conscious decision not to do it. I was trying to find the courage not to play the clarinet. I don't think I was scared; I'm not sure what it was. I felt that the time wasn't right; I was biding my time. The full story is that I'd won a four-year open music scholarship when I left school, and I did three years of that in Manchester, then I did two years' National Service in the Army, and when I came out I had a year left so I went to London, to the Royal Academy. And it was there that I met Alan Hacker, a wonderful clarinet player and a natural musician, and I heard him play the Clarinet Quintet of Mozart, and at last I realised that I would never be a clarinettist. He played like an angel. I'd heard some fairly dashing clarinettists in my life, but Alan was so brilliant, I knew I would never be within light years of that. It was a watershed. I sold my clarinets. I was doing a bit of clarinet teaching once a week at a girls' school, and I sold them to a pupil. God, I tell you, it was a permanent release in my life. I was completely relieved. It's quite something that sometimes I feel happy and I don't know what it is and then I think, I know what it is; I don't play the clarinet any more. I felt I had cast off a lot of things that needed to be cast off; there was this feeling of being welded to the clarinet, that it was going to be my living, but I'd got rid of it, and it was a terribly liberating thing. And as one thing goes out of focus, another comes into focus, and in this case it was the possibility of being a composer, the confidence of thinking I had the wherewithal. It was getting towards the end of that year, and at the same time I wrote a piece of music off the top of my head called "Refrains and Choruses", the first piece of music I'd written since being a schoolboy. In fact it was considered by the Royal Academy to be unplayable, even with a conductor, so I sent it to the Society for the Promotion of New Music, which had a concert at the Cheltenham Festival, and it was performed there and at the Wigmore Hall in London. I got a publisher through it and it was recorded by the Schoenberg Quintet, one of the most famous wind quintets going at the time - I remember getting this recording that had "Birtwistle and Schoenberg" on, because that was the order of the music on the record ... Many years later I went back to the Royal Academy to do a seminar there and they played this piece for me, and it was played by students without any trouble at all, no conductor. I felt that the world had progressed in some ways. But the great thing about that piece was that it encouraged me to write the next piece, and I wrote another piece, and I've never stopped.

With the Canadian dollar having recorded a sizeable appreciation this year, it should come as no surprise that there has been renewed interest among experts and policy makers in the movement in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate and the effects that this movement has had on bilateral trade and the overall Canadian economy.  Not a day seems to go by without some discussion of this important topic in the media, in the business community, in political circles, and amongst the general public. Three factors can explain much of this interest.  The first is the sheer rapidity of the dollar's climb, with the currency having risen by about 20% from January to October.  While the dollar also experienced significant growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the pace of the rise during that period was much less pronounced, enabling Canadian businesses to adjust much more readily.  This time, in the face of a sharper rise, the business response has been more challenging. A second factor is the growing dependence of Canada on trade with the United States, a subject that the Committee has already analyzed extensively in its June 2003 Uncertain Access:  The Consequences Of U.S. Security And Trade Actions For Canadian Trade Policy report.  Canada-U.S. currency fluctuations matter more now than they used to, given this heightened dependence. Finally, any analysis of the effects of a currency appreciation of the scope and speed of the one that we are now experiencing must not be limited to its impacts on international trade, notwithstanding trade's importance to the domestic economy.  This currency "shock" affects all of us, through its impact on Canada's economic growth, on inflation and the monetary policy that the Bank of Canada implements to restrain it, on the domestic employment situation and on the productivity of the economy. This report begins with a discussion of the trends that have been observed in the dollar's movement, both recent and historical.  The determinants of these currency fluctuations over time will then be explained, and consideration given to both internal and external influences on the dollar's recent appreciation.  A second element is an assessment of the economic impacts of the dollar's rise, with the trade impact being reviewed from both a general and sectoral point of view.  The report concludes with a discussion of the appropriateness of the existing exchange rate regime in Canada. The Canadian dollar has appreciated sharply since the beginning of 2003.  Valued at under 64 cents US in the first week of the year, the dollar has risen by roughly 20% through October and is trading at over 76 cents US -- its highest level in nearly ten years.  As Ted Carmichael (Economist, J.P. Morgan Securities Canada) testified, this surge in the value of the Canadian dollar may be unprecedented in the history of Canada's floating exchange rate.  It is all the more remarkable given that, except for a five-year period beginning in 1988, the Canadian currency has been in a decline relative to the U.S. dollar since the mid-1970s.( [1] ) In 1976, the Canadian dollar was trading about at par with the U.S. dollar but fell from about US$1.01 to 76 cents over the next ten years.  This trend was reversed temporarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the dollar rose from a low of 71 cents US in 1986 to over 87 cents in 1991.  However, this rise proved to be short-lived.  A wide range of factors contributed to the dollar falling to a low of about 62.5 cents in April 2002. Although the current rise in the Canadian dollar is attracting considerable attention from experts and policy makers, the fact that the dollar is climbing is not altogether unexpected.  Indeed, as Steven James (Director, Economic Analysis and Forecasting Division, Department of Finance Canada) testified, given the positive economic conditions in Canada, economists have been predicting a rise in the value of the Canadian dollar for a number of years.  The surprise, therefore, is not the fact that the exchange rate is climbing, but the magnitude and the rapidity of the increase. Economists have identified, and closely monitor, a broad range of factors known to influence exchange rates.  All else being equal, these variables have predictable effects on currency movements.  However, since they do not operate in isolation from one another, and since many factors are evident only in hindsight, forecasting or anticipating movements in exchange rates -- particularly in the short term -- is extremely complex.  In fact, as Stephen Poloz (Vice President and Chief Economist, Export Development Canada) wrote in his brief to the Committee, almost any disturbance at all in the domestic or global economy can be shown to affect the exchange rate, making any movement in exchange rates notoriously difficult for economists to anticipate. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that not only are most of the factors known to affect the Canadian dollar interconnected, but in many cases, any movement in the exchange rate in turn affects the economic conditions that may have precipitated that movement in the first place.  For example, a wide margin between exports and imports could result in a large current account surplus in Canada.  This surplus implies a flow of dollars into Canada and places upward pressure on the value of the Canadian dollar.  However, this increase in the dollar would make Canadian exports more expensive and imports into Canada cheaper and thus close the margin between exports and imports and reduce the current account surplus. As such, although exchange rate fluctuations are often treated as exogenous shocks to the Canadian economy, the dollar in fact moves in response to prevailing economic conditions and itself influences those conditions as well.  As John Murray (Head of International Department, Bank of Canada) stated, exchange rates are not capricious.  They move with cause in a way that helps restore macroeconomic balance in Canada. Despite the complex interaction of factors affecting the exchange rate -- in addition to the fact that the exchange rate itself influences economic conditions -- witnesses appearing before the Committee were in broad agreement about the major factors that affect exchange rates in Canada.  A few of the principal determinants of exchange rate movements are described below. The most obvious domestic influence on the Canadian dollar is the health of the Canadian economy.  A strong economy makes Canada an attractive place to invest because it offers the potential for solid economic returns.  This raises demand for Canadian dollars (to invest in Canada) and pushes up the exchange rate.  On the other hand, a relatively weak economy offers more limited investment returns and thus demand for Canadian dollars falls. It is important to note, however, that economic strength is a relative concept.  A prolonged period of robust economic growth in Canada will not result in a higher exchange rate vis--vis the United States if that country grows at the same, or a higher rate over the same period.( [2] )  Similarly, weakness in the Canadian economy will not necessarily translate into a lower Canadian dollar if that weakness also exists in the United States. A number of macroeconomic indicators are frequently used to gauge the fundamental strength of the Canadian economy.  Among the more common of these are government fiscal and current account balances.  In both cases, these indicators point to future levels of foreign indebtedness.  Fiscal and current account deficits imply increased foreign borrowing while surpluses imply foreign lending (or at least reduced foreign borrowing).  In the former case, all else being equal, the Canadian dollar would fall while in the latter, it would rise. Witnesses told the Committee that the Canadian economy has seen a noticeable improvement in recent years.    Since the late 1990s, Canada has run consistent surpluses on both the budgetary and current accounts, leading to a considerable decline in net foreign debt.  In fact, Canada is the only G-7 country with both a current account surplus and a fiscal surplus.  This improvement, especially relative to the US position (discussed further below), is supporting the current appreciation in the Canadian dollar. Economic conditions outside Canada also play a major role in determining the value of the Canadian dollar.  As mentioned above, a relatively strong Canadian economy can have a positive effect on the Canadian dollar.  By extension therefore, economic strength or weakness in foreign countries can also affect their domestic currencies, affecting the exchange rate with the Canadian dollar. The overall state of the global economy can also have a considerable effect on the value of the Canadian dollar.  There are two general reasons why this is so.  The first is that in times of economic uncertainty or instability, investors tend to gravitate toward what are considered 'safe' currencies until the uncertainty passes.  The U.S. dollar has traditionally been the safe haven of investors.  As such, in time of global economic turmoil, the U.S. dollar has typically strengthened relative to most major currencies.  Most recently, this occurred during the Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath, when uncertainty in Asia, Latin America and Russia led investors to flock to U.S. markets. The second way in which world markets influence the Canadian dollar is through their effect on commodity markets.  A strong global economy tends to raise demand for basic commodities while in times of economic weakness, demand falters.  The way in which commodity prices affect the Canadian dollar is discussed below. Because Canada is a large producer and net exporter of resource-based goods, the Canadian dollar is often referred to as a commodity-based currency; the performance of the Canadian dollar is correlated to the strength of world commodity prices.  If commodity prices are high, then resource-based industries are more profitable, making the Canadian economy stronger and thus attracting investment and placing upward pressure on the Canadian dollar.  When commodity prices fall, they undercut revenues for resource-based firms, eroding profits, dampening the domestic economy and pushing down the Canadian dollar. As Steven James pointed out, since movements in the Canadian dollar are correlated to world commodity prices, the exchange rate can act as a buffer against the effects of commodity price fluctuations.  A low dollar partially offsets the drawbacks of low commodity prices by making Canadian exports more globally competitive in that low-price environment.  Conversely, the benefits of high commodity prices are partially offset by a higher dollar. Commodity prices were a major factor behind the Canadian dollar's weakness through most of the 1990s.  Through the first half of the decade, world non-energy commodity prices were essentially flat, growing in line with Canada's inflation rate.  Conditions deteriorated in the second half of the decade, particularly following the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.  Turmoil in the region's financial sector plunged several Asian countries into recession, lowered demand for raw materials and basic goods, causing world commodity prices to fall.  Non-energy commodity prices fell by more than 30% from late 1995 to early 1999, with most of the drop taking place in 1997 and 1998.  From 1999 onwards, non-energy commodity prices remained weak on average, falling by a further 5.8% through to the end of 2002.  For their part, energy prices were also weak through the 1990s, although they have spiked twice in recent years, once in early 2001 when low inventories and strong consumer demand drove prices higher, and again in early 2003 when U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq. When Canadian interest rates are higher than those in the U.S. and other countries, Canada becomes a more attractive destination for short-term foreign capital.    This results in higher demand for Canadian dollar-denominated short-term assets and thus places upward pressure on the dollar itself.  When Canadian interest rates are lower than in the U.S. and other countries, then the opposite holds true and the Canadian dollar typically weakens. Although it is not the policy of the Bank of Canada to intervene in exchange rate markets, it has in the past used its influence over interest rates to defend the value of the Canadian dollar.  In the late 1990s, for example, the Bank raised interest rates in response to a rapid devaluation of the dollar.  Since this move improved the rate of return on Canadian assets relative to U.S. assets, it helped stabilize the value of the currency. Differences in inflation rates between Canada and the U.S. also affect currency movements in the long run.  Inflation is the rate at which prices rise over time and thus measures the erosion of the purchasing power of a dollar.  If prices in Canada were to rise faster than in the U.S., then over time, this would erode the purchasing power -- and thus the value -- of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.  This would be reflected in a decline in exchange rates over time.  Similarly, if inflation in Canada was low compared to in the U.S., there would be some upward pressure on the Canadian dollar as a result. The Bank of Canada adopted a low-inflation policy early in the 1990s.  That policy, combined with a weaker Canadian economy through the first half of the decade kept domestic demand, and thus price growth, relatively low.  As a result, inflation rates in Canada were lower than in the U.S. through most of the 1990s.  However, the positive effect of lower inflation was unable to stop the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar over that period. Several witnesses also identified investor confidence and speculation as factors affecting the exchange rate.  For the most part, investor confidence is swayed by economic factors -- those mentioned above, for example.  However, when assessing future growth prospects, factors such as government policies, perception and political uncertainty can all influence exchange rates.  Michael McCracken (Chair, Informetrica Ltd.) suggested that in the early- to mid-1990s, the threat of Quebec separatism created uncertainty about the future of Canada and the Canadian economy.  This had a negative effect on investors' views of the Canadian dollar. The Committee also received evidence from Stephen Poloz that while exchange rates may ultimately respond to economic fundamentals over the long run, speculative interests will tend to exaggerate those movements in the short run.  A rise in the Canadian dollar could become at least partially self-perpetuating if investors begin to buy into the dollar based solely upon the expectation of future growth.( [3] )  The collapse of the tech stock speculative bubble in September 2000 is an extreme example of this sort of speculative investment artificially driving up asset values.  Witnesses did not suggest that the Canadian dollar was in danger of a similar scenario, rather that the mere fact that the dollar is rising sharply attracts investor attention. Of all the factors known to affect the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar over time, according to John Murray, most long-term movements in the Canadian dollar can be attributed to fluctuations in four of the above-mentioned underlying variables -- the difference in Canadian-U.S. inflation rates; interest rate differentials between the two countries; the world price of energy; and the world price of non-energy commodities.  While these factors do not explain all movements in the Canadian dollar, they have tracked longer-term changes closely. To some extent, the recent rise in the Canadian dollar is reflective of an improvement in those four factors.  The Canadian economy has enjoyed considerable strength in recent years, outpacing GDP growth in the U.S. each year since 1999.  While the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low in that country in an effort to stimulate economic growth, it has not been incumbent upon Canada to exercise the same tightness in its monetary policy.  As shown in Chart 3 above, this has led to a widening gap in interest rates in the two countries.  Higher interest rates make Canada a more attractive destination for short-term investment, thus creating more demand for Canadian dollars and pushing the exchange rate higher. At the same time, data for 2003 to date is showing an improvement in world commodity prices, providing a further boost to the Canadian dollar.  Although energy prices have fallen off since February, they remain considerably higher than their levels in early 2002, while non-energy commodities have enjoyed a modest recovery through 2003, rising by over 15% compared to their values of a year earlier. For their part, inflation rate differentials were a partial offset to these factors as higher auto insurance premiums and energy prices temporarily drove Canadian inflation rates above those in the U.S. earlier in the year.  More recently, inflation in Canada has fallen to about the same levels as in the United States. The Bank of Canada operates a mathematical model that plots a "simulated" value for the Canadian dollar over time as a function of these four variables.  While the Bank's simulation of exchange rate values clearly tracks the actual performance of the Canadian dollar since the mid-1970s, a large gap has emerged since the onset of the current rise in the Canadian dollar.  While the simulation suggests that the Canadian dollar should have improved only modestly in 2003, the actual rise in the dollar has been anything but modest. John Murray suggested that there were two possible explanations for the gap between the actual exchange rate and the Bank's simulated rate.  The first is that the Bank's model is simply lagging behind the actual value of the Canadian dollar and will begin to rise shortly.  This would be similar to the situation in the mid-late 1980s when the Canadian dollar rose sharply in advance of the Bank of Canada's simulation. The second explanation is that the current rise in the Canadian dollar is representative of more fundamental economic forces at work in the United States.  In other words, the current strength in the Canadian dollar is less a result of Canada's relatively sound economic position, as it is of weakness in the United States.  This view was widely shared by other witnesses as well.  As Don Drummond (Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, TD Economics) stated, "this is not a Canadian phenomenon per se.  This is largely ... a weakening of the U.S. dollar." The idea that the rise in the Canadian dollar is largely a U.S.-based phenomenon is evident in the fact that the Canadian dollar is not the only currency to have appreciated in recent months; most major currencies worldwide have made significant gains against the U.S. dollar in 2003.  Indeed, some currencies have appreciated even more rapidly than the Canadian dollar.  In particular, the euro has soared versus the U.S. dollar, rising by 28.4% from January 2002 through September 2003.  The Australian dollar -- another 'commodity currency' like the Canadian dollar has also risen by nearly as much -- 28.3% -- over the same period. As Andrew Jackson (Senior Economist, Canadian Labour Congress) described in his brief to the Committee, the driving force behind the falling U.S. dollar is that country's large trade and current account deficits.  The United States imports nearly $2 of goods for every dollar of exports and is running a current account deficit of around $600 to $700 billion annually with the rest of the world.  This imbalance must be offset by investment.  Since the U.S. must raise funds in order to continue to buy imports, it does so by selling assets such as government bonds. However, investment is not coming from the private sector.  Low interest rates and poor stock market returns in the U.S., along with the expectation of further declines in the U.S. dollar, have deterred private investors from buying U.S. dollar-denominated assets.  Instead, the U.S. current account deficit has been largely financed by foreign governments, particularly in Asia, who are using U.S. dollar bonds to build up their foreign exchange reserves or, in the case of Japan, to prevent a large increase in the value of the yen.  As a result, net foreign debt in the U.S. has soared in recent years, meaning that an increasing proportion of interest payments on U.S. government bonds are flowing out of the United States.  As John Murray stated, the U.S. has gone from being the world's largest creditor in the early 1980s to the world's largest debtor today. The current decline in the value of the U.S. dollar is in large part a response to these conditions.  As John Anania (Assistant Chief Economist, RBC Financial Group) stated, with Americans and their governments borrowing heavily, "people are no longer interested in blindly financing the current account deficit in the U.S., something has to give and in the balance, that is the U.S. dollar.  It has to depreciate to attract that capital into the U.S. right now."  Stephen Poloz agreed, testifying that exchange rates are in a sense, the "ultimate general equilibrium variable," working to keep the economic system in balance.  A lower U.S. dollar will make that country's exports more competitive, raise the price of imports and thus help alleviate its trade and current account deficits. However, the extent to which a lower U.S. dollar will correct these imbalances is limited.  A lower dollar will likely improve U.S. trade balances with Canada and the EU, but as John Murray pointed out, the United States' largest trade deficits are with China and other emerging Asian countries.  In many cases, these countries' currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar and as such, a devaluation in the U.S. dollar will not improve the terms of trade with these Asian countries.  This factor is contributing to the recent pressure by the U.S. on China to revalue its currency. Although normally such a rapid appreciation in the Canadian dollar might not be considered stable, witnesses were in widespread agreement that the current rise in the Canadian dollar would not be temporary.  Instead, it is an appropriate reflection of a change in economic conditions in Canada, the US and around the world.  Indeed, no witnesses were surprised at the fact of the dollar rising in 2003; economic conditions had pointed towards such a rise for a number of years.  It is primarily the rapidity of the appreciation that was unexpected. A major reason that witnesses expected a rise in the exchange rate is the view that the Canadian dollar has been undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar for some time.  Andrew Sharpe (Executive Director, Centre for the Study of Living Standards) stated that, according to the notion of purchasing power parity (PPP) -- a measure of the long-term equilibrium value of the exchange rate at which the price of goods and services in two countries are approximately equal -- the Canadian dollar is worth about 84 or 85 cents US. Other witnesses proposed different measures of what the "appropriate" level of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar should be in the near term.  John Anania and Jim Stanford (Economist, Canadian Auto Workers) both stated that unit labour costs in Canada and the US were about equal when the Canadian dollar was in the low 70-cent range while George Vasic (Chief Canadian Economist, UBS Securities Canada Inc.) suggested that a trade-weighted basket of Canadian commodity exports indicated a similar value for the doll ar. Of all the witnesses appearing before the Committee, not one suggested that economic forces would push the Canadian dollar back to the 63-cent range in the foreseeable future.( [4] )  The main reason for this belief is the view that, while Canadian economic conditions are much improved today compared to the mid-1990s, the appreciation in the Canadian dollar is in fact chiefly the result of a depreciation in the US dollar against most world currencies. When asked for his view on the future direction of the Canadian dollar, Don Drummond testified that "the backdrop is that you have to believe the US dollar will continue to weaken.  They have a huge current account deficit of over 5 per cent of their economy and now their federal government is running about 5 per cent deficits.  Almost all their states have deficits.  There is no reason to think that Canada will not be on the upside of that.  We are roughly in fiscal balance.  We have current account surpluses, higher interest rates and commodity prices are firm.  The direction [of the Canadian dollar] will be up." Some witnesses had alternative hypotheses to explain the decline in the US dollar, but agreed that a lower US dollar was likely here to stay.  According to Stephen Poloz, the US dollar had been overvalued since the late 1990s because global economic uncertainty since that time led investors to flock to 'safe' currencies like the US dollar, driving its value higher.  Anticipating a return to more stable economic conditions in the near future, Mr. Poloz stated that the current devaluation in the US dollar is, in essence, a return to more 'normal' conditions. Furthermore, the Committee heard evidence that the decline in the US dollar was taking place with the implicit approval of the US administration.  As Ted Carmichael stated, given the ballooning current account deficit and the lack of growth in employment and the economy in general, the US is hopeful that a weaker dollar will increase export competitiveness, stem job losses in manufacturing and stimulate economic growth in that country. All this is to suggest that the consensus view of the witnesses was that the Canadian dollar will likely continue to be stronger into the near future.  The only remaining question is how high it will climb.  On this point, many witnesses were reluctant to speculate.  The Committee heard that most recent economic projections called for the dollar to reach about 78 cents US or even to pass 80 cents.  As Don Drummond stated, his most recent forecast in September called for a 78-cent dollar by mid?2004.  However, he admitted that he did not anticipate the dollar reaching 76 cents by the third week of October.  For his part, John Anania did not anticipate a specific value for the dollar, but summarised the consensus view appropriately:  "The key is that we do not think it [the dollar] is going to fall back down.  We think the Canadian dollar will remain valued at today's levels and perhaps increase in 2004 and 2005." As this Committee's June 2003 report noted, there is no doubt that the exchange rate has historically been an important determinant of our trade performance with the United States.  The report also observed that the economic growth differential between the U.S. and Canada contributed heavily to a healthy Canadian export scenario. Most witnesses appearing before the Committee confirmed these observations.  John Murray informed the Committee that the low value of the Canadian currency since the mid-1990s was "one of the important reasons for our strong and improving external position.  It is not the only one, however.  Other important reasons are the free trade agreement and the remarkable growth of the U.S. economy, as well as the fact that it was hitting its capacity limits whereas we were not, so we were a natural source of products and services to meet that rising demand." A number of witnesses suggested that the stronger growth south of the border was, in fact, the single most important factor affecting our exports during the 1990s.  Steven James mentioned that the exchange rate had not been the only influence driving Canadian exports in the 1990s.  He included the North American free trade agreements and the more outward orientation of Canadian firms generally, but especially pointed to the strength of the U.S. economy as a significant factor.  James noted the positive current forecasts of robust U.S. economic growth and remarked that such growth, if it were to come about, would be very positive for our export industries. Someshwar Rao (Director, Strategic Investment Analysis, Industry Canada) provided charts to the Committee suggesting that the strength of the U.S. economy was the principal "driver" of Canada's export performance in the 1990s, although the depreciation of our currency was another important reason for the high export growth.  The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement were considerably less influential, in his view. Stephen Poloz, in a submission received by the Committee, suggested that the weakness of the Canadian dollar, together with the economic growth differentials between Canada and the U.S., were responsible for the vast majority of the export gains realized during the 1992-2002 period.  He placed priority on the latter influence, noting that "trade flows around the world are dictated much less by exchange rates and more by economic growth differentials."  George Vasic concurred with this point of view. While recognizing that the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar had been an important factor in driving trade with the U.S., Don Drummond did not believe that it was the dominant factor.  Instead, he tended to place a lot of weight on the importance of free trade agreements.  He made the point that even though the dollar had been in a steady state of decline since the early 1970s, trade flows did not really begin to rise relative to the economy until the trade liberalization occurred. It is possible to surmise that the effects of the currency changes occurring during the 1990s could have been different had the speed of the currency's decline over the 1990s been more pronounced and had firms been in a more difficult position to adjust appropriately.  As a number of witnesses observed, the situation now is not the same in that, we are facing a currency shock encompassing a speed of change that is virtually unprecedented. So how are the impacts of the current dollar appreciation being felt?  First, there is no doubt that some exporters are curtailing shipments to the U.S. and potentially seeking other markets for their products, just like there are firms importing for the Canadian market who would benefit from the dollar's rise since they can now purchase U.S.-made products at a reduced cost.  For these importers, their sales and profits stand to rise owing to the currency appreciation. Other Canadian exporters are reacting to this appreciation not by raising prices or curtailing product shipments to the U.S. but by enduring a lower rate of profit.  Many of Canada's exports, most notably commodities, automotive and electronic products, are priced in U.S. dollars.  In these situations, the rise in the dollar would not alter the selling prices -- the prices that the buyers would pay.  What would change is the price the exporter in Canada receives as the U.S. dollar export revenues are converted into domestic currency at the now higher exchange rate.  The conversion of sales to the U.S. market from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars in financial statements will tend to reduce reported profits.  As Stephen Poloz remarked, companies could attempt to recover the profit reduction at some future point or respond to the currency change by boosting efficiency and trimming costs so as to restore their profit margins.  On the latter point, George Vasic categorized current profits as being quite high so that any resulting adjustments could be "either delayed or muted."  He generally felt that Canada was fortunately in a favourable economic position to endure the currency appreciation. Finally, in those instances where exports are not priced in U.S. dollars, some Canadian companies may have to lower prices in order not to lose market share either to American producers or increasingly, to low-cost manufacturers such as China.  Regardless of whether the product is priced in U.S. dollars or not, the exporter would continue to price to its foreign market.( [5] ) Fortunately, the story is not all one-sided.  In any analysis of the effects of currency movements on trade, one must look at the interaction between shifts in the level of the real exchange rate and Canada's net exports (exports less imports).  That is, the effect on imports must be examined as well.  As John Murray stated before the Committee, "appreciations have an upside in terms of lower cost of imports and, more specifically, cheaper capital goods, making investment in Canada easier and cheaper and, potentially, but at the margin, promoting productivity growth in this country." Steven James pointed to a "substitution of domestic demand away from domestic production and toward imports," although he did indicate that the magnitude of the pass-through of the higher Canadian dollar into lower import prices could be less now than was previously the case.  He also referred to the lower cost of imported materials, parts, machinery and equipment that now prevailed and that, given that a full 80% of Canadian machinery and equipment is imported, "to the extent that lower prices would boost investment you could see higher productivity growth in Canada going forward and higher potential output growth as well." The existence of more affordable imports is important since, as Stephen Poloz pointed out, Canadian exports today contain approximately 40% in imported content.  While exporters are generally believed to suffer from a rising dollar, manufacturing firms tend to import parts, and especially machinery, from the U.S. and thus they will benefit from a rising dollar (i.e., their input costs will fall).  According to Mr. Poloz, manufacturers are much more likely to be partly "globalized" so that the decline in the cost of imported components would improve their profit margins.  The bottom line is that the adverse effect of the currency appreciation would be muted somewhat. In terms of actual numbers, exports to the U.S. have registered a significant drop in 2003.  In the January-August 2003 period, exports to the U.S. declined by 3.0% from corresponding 2002 figures.  This result contrasts with the rise recorded in our exports to other countries of 3.5%. It is important to note, however, that while exports to the U.S. have fallen through 2003 to date, this decline cannot necessarily be attributed to the effects of the rising dollar.  In addition to the effect of the ongoing U.S. partial ban on beef imports from Canada this year, 2003 marks the third year in a row that exports to the U.S. have declined.  In 2001, exports to the US fell by 2.1%, followed by a 1.8% drop in 2002. In both years, the drop in exports occurred while the Canadian dollar was near record low levels. On the other side of the ledger, imports from the U.S. through 2003 were down by 5.2%, versus an increase of 2.8% for other countries.  While this result is surprising, since imports from the U.S. are now considerably cheaper, other factors may be at play.  One explanation, provided by George Vasic, is that with such a substantial amount of our exports containing imported content, any reduction in our exports would cause the need for the associated imported product to fall as well. This seemingly unprecedented increase in the currency has led some to the conclusion that trade diversification away from the U.S. could leave Canada less vulnerable to rapid changes in currency values.  In its June 2003 report on the Canada-U.S. trade relationship, this Committee stressed the urgency of diversifying Canada's trade.  We argued that "Canada would be better off if its trade dependence on its single largest market to the south was reduced.  This does not mean that our trade with the U.S. should stop growing but rather that trade with other countries should expand at a higher rate."  Undoubtedly, the swift currency appreciation by itself will cause some trade diversification to occur, although the extent of such a shift is not yet fully known. However, greater effort may have to be expended by the federal government "to aggressively seek out comprehensive free trade agreements in Europe and Asia," as our report also stated.  This view was supported by Michael McCracken, who urged the government to "expand export opportunities where you can find them" and to "try to get these other opportunities to happen rather than just chatter about them."  Both Andrew Jackson and Don Drummond also saw the merits of greater export diversification, even if the latter referred to it as a "heroic objective" given that transportation costs for accessing the U.S. market are low and the two countries' consumer tastes are similar.  In terms of priority target markets, Drummond identified China as one with significant potential for Canada. Finally, several witnesses told the Committee that a stronger Canadian dollar relative to that of the U.S. will make the existing assets of Canadian companies more expensive for potential American investors.  In this situation, therefore, it would not be unreasonable to expect a reduction in the purchases of such assets to occur. While the recent increase in the Canadian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate represents a shock for our export-oriented and import-competing industries, the impacts across industrial sectors are uneven.  Focusing on the former set of industries, largely found in the manufacturing sector, the effect of a currency appreciation depends on both (a) export reliance (i.e., the ratio of exports to production) and (b) import content.  While there is no question that the quick rise in the value of the dollar has harmed Canada's export performance and company profitability, it is not the case that all exporters will experience sharply negative effects. The first variable to consider is the level of export dependence.  According to analysis by the TD Bank Financial Group, five industries, accounting for two-thirds of manufacturing production, rely on exports for at least 50% of their production:  transportation equipment, forest products, computer and electronic, machinery, and electrical equipment and components.( [6] )  According to Don Drummond, forestry-related industries are extremely sensitive to exchange rate changes, given that they export almost their entire output. To examine export dependency is insufficient, however; one must also consider the ratio of imported inputs to production.  For example, Canada imports as much as 80% of its machinery and equipment, the declining cost of which will help capital-intensive companies deal with the currency shock.  The larger the above ratio, the less affected by a rising dollar companies will be. The amount of imported content varies by industry, with those with high foreign content in their exports being hurt the least from a currency appreciation.  As it turns out, the transportation equipment industry that is so export dependent also displays the highest ratio of imports to total production.  Other sectors displaying high levels of import content include computer and electronic, textile and textile mills, clothing and leather production.( [7] ) In contrast, industries with relatively low foreign content in their exports are typically the most affected by a rise in the value of the Canadian dollar, in that the low use of imported parts and components does not enable firms to profit from the suddenly cheaper value of imports.  Examples of industries at the low end of the import content scale are the wood and paper industries, which import very little; the food, beverage and tobacco industries; and non-metallic minerals.( [8] ) The real measure of exchange rate risk is derived by subtracting the industry import ratios from the export ratios to obtain estimates of the net export reliance for each industry.  Once the import content is factored in to the initial export dependence numbers, it becomes evident that the most susceptible to the exchange-rate risk are the paper and wood industries.  These industries, apart from having already been hard hit by 27% U.S. customs duties, display both a high export orientation and low import content. Not withstanding the fact that his industry embodies a high degree of import content, and should be partially aided by a rise in the Canadian dollar, Jim Stanford pointed out that the automotive products sector (assembled vehicles and parts) had already experienced a 50% decrease in the net trade surplus in the first half of 2003.  If the dollar were to remain at 75 cents or higher, the surplus would be totally eliminated.  He also said that while exports of energy products and other resources, apart from lumber, were "booming," those of technology-intensive products were not faring as well. As Stephen Poloz and George Vasic reminded the Committee, Canada's trade with the US is not composed solely of merchandise, but it has a strong service sector component as well.  According to Mr. Poloz, services currently account for approximately 20% of total Canadian exports.  However, as Don Drummond pointed out, the services sector is much more oriented towards the domestic market than is the goods sector.  In general, therefore, a higher dollar will have less of an impact on economic activity in services. In cases where Canadian companies do export services, the effect of a high dollar is the same as with goods exports.  However, in many cases, the impact will be more dramatic because, as Stephen Poloz stated, service industries tend to have higher Canadian content than goods industries.  The most severely hit industry in Canada is likely tourism.  A higher Canadian dollar makes it cheaper for Canadians to travel abroad, but more expensive for international visitors to Canada.  Since Canadian tourism is composed of essentially 100% Canadian content, that industry does not benefit at all from lower import prices. However, as John Anania observed, a number of Canadian service industries, which may not be export-driven, will benefit from a higher Canadian dollar.  Education, finance, insurance and real estate services all have high investment rates and capital stocks.  Since computers, software and other machinery and equipment are manufactured abroad, a high dollar lowers the cost of purchasing those goods.  For their part, import-driven industries like retail and wholesale trade will benefit considerably from lower-priced goods from abroad. As a final observation, one could assess which provinces have been most affected by the rise in the value of the currency.  As the submission from Don Drummond pointed out, the answer to this question depends on their relative export intensities and their industrial structure.  Quebec and Ontario appear to have been the most adversely affected in the aggregate, with British Columbia a close third owing to its dominant forest industries.  Notwithstanding this analysis, Drummond urged Committee members to place greater emphasis when considering the currency issue on sectoral rather than regional effects. Jim Stanford attributed much of the job growth since the mid-1990s (450,000 net new manufacturing jobs), increased competitiveness of Canadian investment locations, higher standard of living and overall economic prosperity to the low value of the Canadian dollar.  "Our economy, by virtually every real indicator you can imagine, improved by leaps and bounds since the mid 1990s, and the fact that our currency was at low levels was a crucial part of that." With the higher dollar, the competitiveness situation has now changed.  A key indicator that economists use to measure international competitiveness is "unit labour costs," or the labour costs associated with producing one unit of output.  According to Mr. Stanford, unit labour costs in manufacturing are equalized between the two countries at an exchange rate of approximately 72 cents US.  At this level, the labour cost savings just offset the gap in relative productivity gap between Canada and the United States.  Mr. Stanford informed Committee members that "we need an exchange rate of U.S. 72 cents or lower so that we can maintain the absolute level of unit labour costs in Canadian manufacturing at a competitive level."  If the dollar were to track any higher than 72 cents, it would become more expensive to produce here than in the U.S. and, according to Mr. Stanford, there would be an incentive to move production back south of the border. With the Canadian dollar now trading at over 76 cents U.S., Canada's labour cost advantage over the U.S. has been eliminated.  Moreover, relative productivity in Canada slumped in the first half of this year in conjunction with both a decline in domestic output growth and the productivity improvements south of the border. These developments have dramatically affected Canada's relative competitive position in the short term.  The rapid rise of the dollar has harmed profit margins across all export-oriented industries and this profit squeeze is forcing Canadian firms to lower costs and improve productivity in order to defend profit margins. This points to a stagnation or reversal of Canada's healthy employment gains of 2002.  Not only have manufacturers tried to lower costs by reducing employment levels, but the rise in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate has also made the hiring of new labour less attractive relative to capital (i.e., machinery and equipment), because the currency's appreciation has lowered the cost of capital imports.  All told, the first half of the year saw a net loss of 64,000 manufacturing jobs in Canada. Admittedly, not all of these job losses can be attributed exclusively to the currency appreciation.  More difficult economic conditions in the first half of 2003 could account for many of the employment reductions.  Another point to consider is that the dollar's appreciation could well benefit Canadians in the future through a possible improvement in productivity, as the next section of the report will discuss. A number of witnesses told the Committee that one of the most important impacts of a stronger currency was the effect it would have on productivity in Canada.  Productivity is key to the long-run improvement of living standards.  Increasing economic output per unit of input improves international competitiveness which, in turn, can lead to higher output, profits, wages and, in the long run, employment gains.  Most witnesses felt that an increase in the Canadian dollar would have a positive effect on productivity -- the "silver lining" of a higher dollar, as George Vasic stated. Andrew Sharpe identified four channels through which exchange rates are believed to affect productivity.  In two cases, a high exchange rate is believed to positively affect productivity while the other two cases are thought to have the opposite effect. The first channel is the exchange rate sheltering hypothesis, also known as the "lazy manufacturers hypothesis."  According to this theory, lower exchange rates increase firms' relative international competitiveness, making them more profitable but reducing the incentive to make productivity-enhancing investments.  A number of witnesses dismissed this theory as largely implausible.  As Jim Stanford stated, "The level of competition amongst Canadian manufacturers is incredibly intense -- there is no gentlemen's club where they sit down together to talk about the economy.  They are out to eat each other's lunch.  Moreover, anyone can come to Canada and take advantage of those relative low prices with a low dollar and still use new technology and new productivity to improve their profit margins."  The Committee also heard that a low dollar only increases competitiveness with respect to foreign suppliers; domestic competition remains unaffected. The second channel is the factor price hypothesis.  As alluded to above, when the exchange rate appreciates, this should make the use of capital more attractive than labour in the production process since the exchange rate affects the cost of imported equipment and software more than the cost of labour.  Over time this would lead to an increase in the use of capital, a decrease in labour intensity, and an improvement in productivity. The third way in which exchange rates can affect productivity is by affecting firms' capacity to invest (the productivity investment effect).  Since a lower exchange rate increases competitiveness and profitability, it leaves firms with more money to invest in productivity-enhancing improvements. Finally, there is the foreign investment effect.  Lower exchange rates make it more attractive for foreign companies to invest in Canada because of the resulting lower labour costs.  Firms can bring their machinery, equipment and technological innovations to Canada, potentially leading to strong productivity gains.  This effect is limited, however, by the extent to which Canada attracts foreign direct investment. On balance, Andrew Sharpe felt that a stronger dollar would, in most sectors, increase productivity and competitiveness.  Most witnesses agreed -- largely because of the effects of the factor price hypothesis.  Canadian firms import up to 80% of their equipment, machinery and software from the United States.  As John Anania stated, "we have found in the past that Canadian companies tend to depend a little bit more on labour than capital.  That has key implications, as far as labour productivity is concerned.  The larger your capital stock, the more productive your labour force will be."  As such, the substitution of capital for labour raises productivity, potentially offsetting any loss in export competitiveness because of the higher dollar. How the various industries will benefit (from an investment point of view) from a higher dollar depends on the amount of machinery, equipment and software used in the production process in relation to the value added that the industries in question contribute.   Within the manufacturing sector, capital-intensive industries such as primary metals, oil and gas, chemicals and paper head the list.  Apart from manufacturing, education and related services, truck transportation, broadcasting and telecommunications and agriculture also stand out.( [9] ) Not all of the witnesses, however, were disciples of the "high dollar high productivity" scenario.  Jim Stanford argued for the productivity investment effect -- that the existence of a low dollar would strengthen productivity and that a higher dollar would cause profit margins to decline.  In turn, lower profits would result in less money being available for investment purposes. This view was shared by Michael McCracken, who pointed out that a currency appreciation would dampen retained earnings and corporate profits, thereby reducing investment flows.  He noted that ultimately how industries react to cheaper imports of machinery and equipment will depend on what the adverse effects of the currency appreciation on the industry or sector in question are. In his brief to the Committee, Andrew Jackson supported the foreign investment effect.  He remarked that the fall in the value of the dollar in the 1990s had "helped compensate for the relatively poor investment record of Canadian business, particularly investment in new plants and in research and development," by attracting new foreign investment in a number of economic sectors. Still another witness, Someshwar Rao, suggested that the focus on the currency and its effect on productivity may be misplaced.  "The problem seems to be in the future.  If we want to improve our trade performance, it is not so much the dollar that we should worry about -- we cannot control the dollar -- but it is the productivity that we have to worry about.  That will improve our real wages and at the same time improve our cost position and trade performance." In his submission to the Committee, Mr. Rao observed that the improvement in Canada's cost competitiveness relative to the U.S. can be entirely attributed to the depreciation of the currency.  However, increased cost competitiveness does not automatically translate into a rise in a country's standard of living unless it is brought about through an increase in productivity.  On that score, Canada has not performed very well as its labour productivity in manufacturing rose by only 50% of the U.S. rate in the 1990-2002 period.  By 2002, the economy-wide labour productivity level gap between the two countries was 16% and that in manufacturing a full 35%. Don Drummond agreed that improving productivity growth was of critical importance to the long-run success of the Canadian economy, trumping the issue of the appreciating Canadian dollar.  He stated "I do not think the fluctuations or the rise in the dollar are the main issue.  The main issue for the Canadian economy is our substandard productivity performance vis--vis the United States.  If we can find the key to resolving that, our dollar would probably continue to rise under those circumstances, but we would probably not care much about it.  We would be in a competitive position and our standard of living would rise." Will the appreciation of the Canadian dollar lead to lower inflation and, if so, will that development lead the Bank of Canada to lower interest rates?  Undoubtedly, exchange rate movements can have a direct effect on the prices of traded goods and services and, thus, on inflation.  The recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar should result in a dampening of the growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a commonly used measure of inflation.  A higher dollar lowers the cost of imports while leaving the cost of domestically-produced goods unchanged.  It should be noted, though, that Bank of Canada research reveals that in countries such as Canada, the impact of currency fluctuations on consumer prices during low inflation periods (such as the one now being experienced) has been far more modest than those experienced during high inflation periods. At the present time, movements in the value of the dollar do not play a large role in shaping Canadian monetary policy; the Bank of Canada is almost exclusively focused on guarding against inflation.  Whenever a sizeable currency movement occurs, the Bank of Canada attempts to determine if the change has been caused by fundamentals or by a loss of confidence.  In the former case, it normally refrains from taking action based on simply the exchange rate level.  For example, it decided in mid-October not to raise interest rates, sensing that other positive economic developments (e.g., the strength of the U.S. economy and its demand for Canadian exports; the rebound in the global economy as evidenced by the surge in commodity prices) were serving as offsets to the exchange-rate effect. The Committee heard mixed views on whether the Bank of Canada should more explicitly take into account fluctuations in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate when conducting its monetary policy.  Stephen Poloz informed the Committee that maintaining the overriding objective of the Bank to achieve a low, stable inflation rate represented an appropriate monetary policy.  To him, achieving stability in the rate of inflation implies that, over time, the economy will attain an output level approaching full employment.  Andrew Sharpe and John Anania also voiced their approval of the Bank's current policy direction. However, not everyone appearing before the Committee shared these views.  Other witnesses informed the Committee that the Bank of Canada should broaden its focus to help moderate the effects of the currency fluctuations.  For example, Mike McCracken told the Committee that the Bank of Canada should concentrate on more than just the CPI and that the federal government should respond to the current exchange-rate situation with lower interest rates.  The latter suggestion was echoed by Andrew Jackson in his submission to the Committee. Jim Stanford also argued that the Bank of Canada should devote greater attention to the exchange rate in its conduct of monetary policy.  In essence, he believed that the Bank should adopt a broader and more flexible monetary policy rule, as opposed to simply targeting inflation. Economic theory informs us that an appreciation of the dollar will impose transitional costs on the Canadian economy, lowering Canadian exports, raising our imports, negatively affecting our trade balance and lessening this country's GDP growth rate.  Experts generally predict that the strong Canadian dollar will restrict economic growth both this year as well as in 2004. However, forecasts of the consequence of a currency appreciation can vary.  As Don Drummond noted, a Bank of Canada model indicates that the combined 12% rise in the Canadian dollar in the first half of 2003 would lead to a 1.8 percentage point reduction in real economic growth over the next 12 months.  For its part, the federal Department of Finance calls for a reduction in GDP growth of roughly 1% in both 2003 and 2004. In his appearance before the Committee, Stephen Poloz cast additional doubts on the accuracy of forecasting the impacts of currency changes on growth.  He suggested that the typical rule of thumb for an open economy such as Canada is that a 1% appreciation leads to a 0.3% decline in our GDP during the following 12 months.  However, he argued that it is virtually impossible to determine the effects of movements in the exchange rate on the Canadian economy.  As the argument goes, the effect of currency fluctuations depends on the source of the movement so that the above simple theoretical analysis does not always work.  Moreover, the Canadian economy is changing, so that any effects are more uncertain over time.  In other words, the observed relationship between the dollar and the economy is fundamentally ambiguous. Regardless of whether or not it is possible to precisely determine the impact of the currency appreciation on the Canadian economy, Donald Drummond cautioned that the effect may not be so dramatic as compared to previous appreciations because:  (a) many Canadian firms have hedged their foreign currency positions to guard against exchange-rate fluctuations; (b) the import content of our exports has grown, and the dollar's decline and associated drop in the price of these imports serves as a useful offset for firms' profit situation; (c) more and more Canadian firms are borrowing in U.S. dollars, serving as an offset to the rising dollar because the cost of their loans has been reduced; and (d) increasing numbers of Canadian firms are generating US dollars in their U.S. operations. Most importantly, four other points need to be made to mollify existing concerns about the adverse effect of the rising dollar on the Canadian economy.  The first is the potential for productivity gains, which has been already discussed in the report.  Reduced costs and enhanced productivity are essential to future competitiveness and long-term economic growth.  Second, a strong Canadian dollar boosts the real purchasing power and net worth of Canadian consumers and investors.  It can be thought of as the equivalent of a national pay hike for many in society.  Third, the U.S. economic recovery in the past few months has been very robust, and forecasts generally expect a continuation of this positive performance into 2004.  A spirited expansion of the U.S. economy should generate additional demand for Canadian exports and, therefore, positive economic growth.  Some experts, in fact, suggest that such a development could dwarf the effects of the currency rise on our trade performance.  According to Stephen Poloz, "the Canadian economy will see solid growth next year and it will see increased international trade in spite of and because of the rise in the Canadian dollar." Fourth, the global recovery underway is causing a surge in basic commodity prices, a development that is of benefit to Canada.  For example, as Mr. Poloz indicated to the Committee, the world price of nickel had increased by a full 70% during the past year, more than offsetting the effects of the concurrent rise in the Canadian dollar. In sum, while the currency appreciation has been unprecedented in terms of its speed and there will no doubt be costs in the transition to a more appropriate valuation of the Canadian dollar, the Committee was informed that many of the effects of the exchange rate development may be offset by other developments in the North American (e.g., strong U.S. economic growth) and global economies (e.g., higher commodity prices).  At the same time, many witnesses noted that a higher dollar presents the opportunity for productivity gains, an improvement in our international buying power and a higher standard of living in Canada. As a final consideration, the Committee also received evidence on what form of exchange rate regime would be best for Canada.  Other than the period from 1962 to 1970, during which Canada's exchange rate with the United States was fixed, market forces have determined the value of the Canadian dollar from World War II to the present.  Since 1971, when the U.S. delinked its dollar from gold, Canada's monetary system has been anchored exclusively by flexible exchange rates.  No other developed country can claim such a sustained and generally crisis-free track record with flexible rates. The Committee, in its June 2003 report, had already expressed its concern that the costs of abandoning the Canadian currency (i.e., loss of the dollar as a "shock absorber," elimination of sovereignty over monetary policy) would far exceed any reduction in transactions costs that could arise from a monetary union with the U.S. Virtually all of the witnesses appearing before the Committee agreed that the exchange-rate flexibility currently in place continues to be the best option for Canada, and that there is no need to consider alternative exchange rate systems.  John Murray informed the Committee that not only does short-run exchange volatility impose only limited costs, currency flexibility offers important advantages such as policy independence and the ability of the currency to partially insulate the Canadian economy from external economic shocks.  Andrew Sharpe concurred with the importance of having an adjustment mechanism in place to shelter the economy from such shocks. Jim Stanford was of the opinion that the "policy independence granted by the exchange rate, as well as the shock-absorbing features of it, are important, particularly if we were to consider a monetary union or common currency because we would lose the ability to set domestic interest rates.  That would be a huge mistake."  According to Mr. Stanford, the introduction of a common currency would equal dollarization, with the most that Canada could anticipate receiving from this monetary development would be one seat on the Federal Reserve Board. The view that a monetary union, involving a brand new North American currency, was not in the cards was also shared by Don Drummond.  For him, a common currency between Canada and the U.S. should only be considered if the structure of the two countries' economies were similar.  At the present time, he stated, Canada is considerably more dependent upon commodities for its economic performance than is its southern neighbour and this situation will not likely change in the foreseeable future. In contrast, Ted Carmichael wondered whether currency fluctuations were, in the long term, "beneficial for increasing Canada-U.S. trade, making Canada-U.S. trade more stable over time and adding to the ability of the Canadian economy to create wealth, jobs, increase productivity, and so on."  While he admitted that a flexible exchange rate system was useful in absorbing exogenous shocks, he felt that the fluctuations in the dollar had themselves "destabilized the Canadian economy" and that it was not healthy to have the dollar's movement cause such large shifts in the relative competitiveness of Canadian industry.  He advocated the introduction of a common North American currency (encompassing Mexico, the United States and Canada) and thought that this longer-term issue should be debated in the same way as the short-term currency appreciation issue is now being discussed. One point that everyone appearing before the Committee could agree on was that it did not make much sense to fix, or peg, the Canadian dollar to that of the United States.  We heard that it is very difficult to know with precision at what rate to fix it and that such a move to greater exchange-rate fixity might involve some unintended consequences.  To quote from Carmichael, fixed exchange rates "come under pressure and eventually do not hold.  Sometimes they lead to exchange crises that lead to great destabilization in the economies in question."  John Murray gave the Committee the case of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis as an example of the unfortunate effects of unsustainable currency pegs. Finally, another problem with fixed exchange rates is the burden that they place on a country's monetary policy.  As Don Drummond put it, in those countries fixing their currencies "you have to dedicate your interest rate policy to fixing the exchange rate.  That gives you the worst of the worlds.  The interest rates can wreak havoc on your domestic economy much more readily than the changing of exchange rates, so in trying to address a situation that some might think is undesirable you create a much worse situation." Professor Peter Morici, Professor of International Business, Robert H. Smith School of Business April 29, 2003 ([1])       It is important to note that although the Canadian dollar fell considerably against the US dollar through the 1990s, its performance relative to other major currencies has been more stable. ([2])       Although, if both Canada and the US were to outpace other major world economies, the Canadian dollar would likely rise against those other currencies. ([3])       The opposite would also be true -- investors selling the Canadian dollar through the 1990s based on the expectation that it would continue to fall. ([4]) However, some, like Jim Stanford, believed that the Bank of Canada should intervene in exchange rate markets by lowering interest rates and pushing the Canadian dollar lower. ([5])       Andrew Jackson informed the Committee that commodity exports to countries other than the U.S. were also affected by the change in the value of the U.S. dollar, since those commodities are priced in U.S. dollars.

NA ne	For last four years, sparkly vampires and shape-shifting wolfmen have joined spandex-wearing superheroes as the biggest franchise figures at a theater near you.  But the sparkliness of those vampires is set to dim, as The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 closes out the five-film series this Friday, November 16th. The new film concludes the two-part adaptation of the last novel in Stephenie Meyer 's story spanning four bestselling novels.  When last we saw Bella, the newlywed was also a newly-minted vampire and mother.  As she adapted to her new supernatural lifestyle in Breaking Dawn - Part 2 , the nefarious Volturi are mistakenly informed that she and Edward's child, Renesmee, is a volatile and dangerous Immortal Child.  In order to protect their progeny, who was actually born a vampire, from the Volturi, Bella, Edward, and the Cullens must marshal a fighting force of vampires and werewolves, setting the stage for a climactic final battle. At the Los Angeles press day for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 , IAR was one of many international entertainment outlets on hand to discuss the sequel with the cast and principal creative figures. Kristen Stewart , Robert Pattinson , and Taylor Lautner were on hand to enthusiastically discuss the latest entry in this franchise and the conclusion of a ridiculously successful pop culture phenomenon. This movie marks a big change for Bella as a character as she shifts from human to vampire.  Having been something of an outsider amongst both her human friends and the vampiric Cullen family for four movies, Bella is now adapting to having superpowers and a thirst for blood.  Her new abilities meant a new challenge for Stewart , who was called upon to perform complicated stunts for action sequences. "I broke my thumb maybe like the first or second day of our really sort of intense action-y type stuff," she recalled. "So that was really frustrating, but it was fun. I think I got a little taste of it. I got a little taste of it when we were in Italy just like the physicality was so important then and it finally became important again. And I don't know, what can I say? I think I'd been on the sidelines for so long, just itching, going like, 'God, I think I could do that pretty well. I think I could do that pretty well. I think those contacts are going to look pretty cool.' No sorry. I was like bursting to do it. And which I think is probably why I broke my thumb. I was a little overzealous." For Lautner , as well, the story finds his character in new territory.  After being one-third of a love triangle for several films, Jacob Black's focus in now on protecting Renesmee, played by Mackenzie Foy .  In Breaking Dawn - Part 1 , Jacob imprinted on the newborn, devoting himself to her well-being entirely.  In depicting the relationship between Jacob and Renesmee, Lautner was aware of the delicacy of their dynamic, saying, "It's a fine line and I was worried about it. We were very fortunate to have Stephenie Meyer , the author, on set with us for these last two movies, and I definitely had quite a bit of conversations with her. There's really nobody better to ask about it than her. And she basically told me, I mean, 'Stop over-complicating it.' She's like, 'Just think here and now that's all you really have to focus on, and it's simple.' She said, 'It's a lifelong bond between two people and that's it. At this point the girl's like what, ten years old? So it's more of a protective thing like a brother sister and that's really all it is.' And I couldn't allow myself to think ahead, and go beyond that. So that's kind of the zone I had to stay in. And I think Bill , our director, did a tremendous job with it because it is delicate, and I think the fans are going to be happy with it. I think it came together well." Playing an immortal vampire has never been simple for Pattinson , and the obstacles of playing Edward Cullen in the fifth film were largely the same in past movies, according to the actor. "It's a kind of a strange part," he explained. "Because on one hand, a lot of the audience projects their idea of Edward on to him without, you know, it doesn't matter what he is, it's like they want him to be a certain way, and then my kind of instincts to try and play it, to try and find the fallibility in him, and the weaknesses. So it's you're trying to play both these things at the same time, and it becomes very strange, I mean, because you're trying to play someone who is seen by a lot of people as being like this perfect thing, but what is that? It doesn't really mean anything, and so you're trying to play an archetype on one hand, and then the character on the other. So I kind of felt insanely frustrated right up until the last shot, and then it ended." While Pattinson was playing a vampire from day one, Stewart had the benefit of establishing her character as a human and developing her for four films, then playing the transition, as she said, "I was really lucky to have played human Bella for so long. The best aspects of every vampire, all of their gifts, everything that makes them really special is always an enhanced version of what they were when they were human, so I really did get to play an incredibly well rounded version of a vampire just because I got to take those steps for real. I think that she, I always say the same thing, but if you were to take the fact that she becomes a vampire completely away, it's just a more realized version of who she's been the entire time. I think it's why it really touches so many people, I think, too. It's like it really does represent that stage of life where you're full, pumping, full of, like bubbling over with something that maybe you can't put your finger on. And if you're the type of person, like in this case, not like a huge thing about the girl thing, but like a girl who has faith in themselves to not ignore those feelings and find out why they're there.  And people kind of think she's nuts the entire time. It's like Bella's always losing it. She's making very odd decisions and, you know, they're full informed by feeling. And I think that now it all makes sense and she can kind of stand up and go, 'Whew, I told you. It was worth it and we held on for a reason.' And yeah, really satisfying, really like a lot of fun. A lot of fun. It was also like breaking her in like a car as well. Like how fast does it go? And it was fun." Despite her stunt injury, part of the fun for Stewart was in cutting loose with Bella's physicality. "I would love to be able to run that fast," she said. "That would be fun. And we really didn't get to -- that's the one thing that we were able to really get close to most experiences that she has, we always wanted to push it as far as we could, but then when I'm standing on a treadmill being drug behind a truck in the woods and I know that this isn't going to even make it in the movie, because it's fairly ridiculous, and I just wanted to be able. And that's my favorite, honestly, that's one of my favorite part in that entire series, is that first hunt, is just like going. I didn't really feel like I could go. It was very frustrating. So if I could do that." For months, scuttlebutt and speculation have surrounded just what will become of Twilight as a property now, in this age of ubiquitous reboots and franchise thinking.  For Pattinson , regarding the stories in such a way is beside the point, as he explained, "Franchise is a Burger King or a Subway, it's not a movie. And people, people who start to say it, generally are the people who are making money off it, like, refer to it [as a] franchise. I guess they love it when something's become a franchise. But as, as an actor, I think it's scary. I mean, you really, really feel like you have no control. I mean it's a huge juggernaut, especially when something becomes part of the kind of cultural landscape in a way. It's really scary, because you get trapped, and you get scared of changing, which is the worst thing that can happen if you want to be any kind of artist." That said, the end of the series naturally has audiences looking back, particularly on the first film, 2008's Twilight . Lautner , the youngest of the three leads, looked back on his experience with that production and was surprised to realize he had no recollection of meeting Pattinson , but recalled his earliest encounter with Stewart , saying, " Kristen , it was kind of awkward for me because I was showing up midway through filming. I was only in like two or three scenes in the first movie. And everybody kind of had, you know, relationships and everybody knew each other. It was already this family environment and I was kind of barging in. So I was nervous. I was also the youngest. And it was, actually it probably was a little awkward when we first did meet each other. We were filming a scene on the beach and the weather was insane. It was pouring rain, and there was wind, and I was wearing the nasty wig. It was just very uncomfortable but ever since then it's been great." "It's funny, people were asking me how I'd feel when it all ends on the first movie," Pattinson said. "And I don't think I've ever felt more completely bewildered, knowing that I only have a month of Twilight stuff left to do. I don't know. I always, I've said since, I think the second one, it's going to take ten years to really settle in my brain. So I'm four years into it. But yeah, I don't think there's any, I don't think there is any analysis. I don't think anyone knows why people like it. I don't think even the fans know why they connect to it in the way they do. It's a visceral thing." Bewilderment aside, Pattinson does look back fondly on the films, particularly the first one, saying, "The whole first movie was pretty fun. I'd never really done a movie like it where there's such a big cast of people who were around about the same age, and everyone didn't really know what was going to happen with the movie, but there was a good energy, there was something, which people were kind of, like, fighting for in a way. They wanted it to be, they wanted it to be something special. Also, the people. None of us were really known, then, as well. So it was kind of, it felt like a big deal at the time, and it was exciting, it was really exciting, the first one, and the whole year afterwards. It was an exciting year." Similarly, Lautner focused on the bonds he formed with his fellow actors. "That's the biggest thing I'll take from this is those relationships," he said. "We're so close right now. They're some of my best friends and that won't go away at all. You know it will be more difficult because we don't have the excuse to spend months and months, and day after day with each other, but you know our friendships will go on forever. I find it so amazing that this cast meshed so well, and like got along so well, and it really...we're so thankful for that. We have a blast every time we film these movies, every time we promote them, and I really think that's like a miracle. It was an amazing experience, and those relationships that are going to be the biggest thing that I'll take from it." "I've learned a lot," he continued. "I mean in the sense that I've just grown up a ton because I did start this when I was fifteen years old. So I mean that's kind of just bound to happen, but you know it also is kind of at an accelerated rate. And also just working, I mean as an actor having the opportunity to work with some of the people in this franchise. I love the fact that we had different directors for each movie except for these last two. That was amazing, to play the same character, but be directed in a different way every time and have different input. So I mean it's kind of an actor's dream because of that, and to play one character for so long because usually when you do a normal film you play the character for three months, and then you say goodbye to them, and then you watch the movie, and you're like, 'Oh I wish I could have done that differently. I wish I could have added this to it.' And with this you have four more movies to play with. So it is. it was an amazing experience." For all three actors, Twilight entailed an almost immediate ascent to global stardom, and the end of the franchise means a new phase in their respective careers.  According to Stewart , though, it is immensely satisfying to know that the story has reached its conclusion. "I'm so happy that the story is told," she said. "You have no idea. Usually you've got five weeks, five months to look at a schedule and go, 'Whew, that day's coming up, that day's coming up.' We had five years. And so, you know, the fact that this thing is out and it's not weighing on us anymore, super excited about that. But I don't want it to sound like I'm excited just to be done with the experience, because to be honest, it's like such a particular tone, anything, you do an interview for Twilight , you go back. But anything, like reshoots, conversations with past directors, anything. It's just like it falls right back into that. It's a feeling, and I will definitely miss that. But again, I feel like it's not going anywhere. I feel like anytime something's brought up or you see someone, I mean, it is sad, it is strange. But it's normal, things shouldn't stay stagnant. Got to move on." The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 hits theaters across the country on Friday, November 21st.
IN	It was the summer of 2007, and Peter Vidani sat in plush blue chair in the middle of a hotel hallway. Downtown Los Angeles was dead this particular evening. The only sounds to be heard were humming of the elevator, the occasional laugh from a room down the hall, and the gentle whir of a laptop he used to browse Tumblr -- his latest obsession. Vidani was on a security detail. He only had two responsibilities that night: to make sure the contestants of America's Next Top Model never left the hotel and to escort them from their rooms down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast in the morning. "They were just these pretty young girls; they were obviously having a blast," Vidani told the Daily Dot. "Every once in awhile I would glance up to see if anyone was around. It was ridiculous. [The girls] could have easily left through the staircase in the back instead of taking the elevators." Now five years later, Vidani is a different sort of guardian. As Tumblr's sixth employee, Vidani is the company's guru of design, managing a team of five responsible for making the blog -- from the small buttons on the dashboard to the entire iPhone application -- look good.

NA ne	The number of single-parent families in Britain has reached the 2 million mark for the first time, official figures show. As more couples shun weddings, children are increasingly likely to live with unmarried parents as married ones. Some 8,000 same-sex couples now have children, the Office for National Statistics said, while almost 8million people are living alone. The figures highlight the continuing decline in popularity of marriage, despite claims that it provides the most stable background for children and attempts to promote it by leading politicians including David Cameron. The ONS's bulletin , published on Thursday, shows that in 2011 there were 17.9m families in Britain. Of these, 7.6m were married or in civil partnerships and childless, while 4.5m had children under 16. Related Articles But although married couples "are still the most common family type", their number is declining as more relationships break down and fewer couples choose to wed. Over the past decade the number of married couples fell by 262,000 to 12m, while the number of cohabiting couples rose from 2.1m to 2.9m. There are now 1.8m young people living with unmarried parents. The ONS said the types of families with children "changed significantly" between 2001 and 2011, with 62 per cent of children now living with married parents, 14 per cent with cohabiting couples and 24 per cent with a single parent. The number of lone parents with children has risen "steadily but significantly" from 1.7m to 1.96m, rounded up to 2m by the ONS. Almost all (92 per cent) of these single parents were women: "Women are more likely to take the main caring responsibilities for any children when relationships break down, and therefore become lone parents." Increasing numbers of same-sex couples are living together (63,000) and entering into civil partnerships (59,000), with 8,000 said to have children. More couples had one child rather than two or more in 2011 compared with a decade ago, but the ONS said this could just be down to women "postponing their childbearing to older ages". Overall, there were 26.3m households in Britain in 2011, up 7 per cent since 2001 as a result of immigration and people living in smaller units. The proportion of households containing just one person rose by some 700,000 over the past decade, to reach 7.7m. Among 16 to 64 year-olds, more men live alone as they are more likely to never marry. But over 65 the "pattern is reversed", partly because women tend to live longer. Adults in the "1960s baby boom generation", aged 45 to 64, have fuelled the rise in the number of single-person households in recent years as fewer people from that generation have chosen to marry,
OP ob	Share this Article Tags: Dr. Josef Mengele held a doctorate in anthropology from Munich University and a medical degree from Frankfurt University. He was an early medical pioneer in "after-birth abortions." His groundbreaking research was conducted at his world renowned clinic in Auschwitz, Poland. Evil comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, sounds, and smells. Many people (particularly liberals, progressives, and non-believers) are uncomfortable with the idea that monstrously evil individuals can also have the capacity to laugh, love their dogs, love their children and parents, be part of a community, and have a pleasant appearance. These people would prefer to see evil as a function of some psychological/physiological abnormality rather than attribute it to a "choice" for which the individual is fully responsible. In this view, evil people should have nothing in common with us; they are some bizarre, diseased branch of humanity. The reason for this delusionary view of reality is simple. It is rather frightening to confront the notion that if evil is a "choice" open to all human beings, then "I" am also capable of choosing evil. It gets worse. Just as most evil people seem absolutely convinced that they are right and are oblivious to the evil that they perpetrate, or seem totally unaware that their ideas are perverse and corrupt, then how do I really know that I am different? Maybe my ideas are perverse and corrupt, maybe my actions are reprehensible and I am oblivious and unaware of their true nature. Let's face it, just about everybody thinks they are right. "All of a man's ways are proper in his own eyes..." (Proverbs) No, anyone is capable of choosing evil, even those who seem to be perfectly normal and just like us. Let us then confront evil in the form of two young smiling faces; one a handsome young man, Dr. Alberto Giubilini;  the other a rather pretty young woman, Dr. Francesca Minerva.  Both hold PhD's in philosophy from prestigious universities. At some unknown twist or turn along their path to academic "enlightenment" Dr.'s Giubilini and Minerva traded in their souls and humanity for some perverse and profoundly evil ideology they call "ethics." They are co-authors of an article in The Journal of Medical Ethics (2/23/12), entitled, "After-birth abortion: Why should the baby live?" They argue -- quite logically and coherently -- that if it is justifiable to "kill a human fetus" then it is also justifiable to "kill a newborn human" because "merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life." Infants are not "persons" in the sense that they have a "moral right to life...in these cases, since non-persons have no moral rights to life, there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions."  (For those who are unfamiliar with the term "after-birth abortion," it used to be called "infanticide" or "first-degree murder.") Please note that Minerva and Guibilini apply this principle to fully healthy babies who are simply unwanted by their parents. However, they do raise the question of putting the baby up for adoption: "Why should we kill a healthy newborn when giving it up for adoption would not breach anyone's rights but possibly increase the happiness of people involved (adopters and adoptee)?" Dr. Francesca Minverva, this deceptively beautiful smile may be the last thing a newborn baby ever sees. Dr. Peter Singer, "bioethicist" at Princeton University is the intellectual father of the animal rights movement. He has stated that "nothing is intrinsically wrong." Sometimes Satan comes as a man who loves animals. They provide us with an interesting answer to this question: "On this perspective, the interests of the actual people involved matter, and among these interests, we also need to consider the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving her child up for adoption...we are suggesting that, if interests of actual people should prevail, then after-birth abortion should be considered a permissible option." (Makes perfect sense to me.) As could be expected, the suggestion that it is perfectly all right to kill a healthy newborn baby because putting it up for adoption would cause the mother "stress" has raised a storm of controversy. The editor of The Journal of Medical Ethics, Julian Savulescu, decried what he called the "hate speech" directed at the authors of the article. He also added that the pushback against the article shows that "proper academic discussion and freedom are under threat from fanatics opposed to the very values of a liberal society." (If the values of a "liberal society" include murdering newborn babies then count me as a member of the fanatical opposition.) One of the earliest recorded cases of a late term "after-birth abortion." In this case the white parents suffered tremendous "psychological stress" when they discovered, much to their chagrin, that their twin sons were "colored." Although there were offers of adoption, they decided that a life where the boys would have to use separate toilets and drinking fountains was not a life worth living. Note the primitive, but effective, "rope and tree" technique used to perform the abortion. Modern sophisticated techniques include "starvation," "death by poisoning" (politely called "lethal injection" in the Netherlands), and "drop the brat in a dumpster." Savulescu also defended the article by pointing out that "infanticide is practiced in the Netherlands" and that these arguments have already been advanced by well known "bioethicists" such as Peter Singer and Michael Tooley. "The goal of the Journal of Medical Ethics ...is to present well reasoned arguments based on widely accepted premises...the authors proceed logicallyfrom arguments which many people accept." Of course, in Nazi Germany the premise that Jews were a mortal threat to the Aryan people was also a "widely accepted" premise and genocide was practiced in Nazi Occupied Europe and Russia. What is most frightening of all is the banal, matter-of-fact manner in which these highly educated academics build a case for the murder of babies. In fact it is the deadly logical consequence of an atheistic worldview in which human life has no inherent value but only as much value or non-value as is assigned to it by those in power. It is the deadly logical consequence of a worldview that values self-indulgence and self-gratification above any other consideration. The "sexual revolution" of the 60's led to the acceptance of the notion that unlimited sexual freedom is a basic human right; sexual freedom must include unlimited access to contraception and abortion because pregnancy and babies bring with them a powerful dose of reality and responsibility (what a way to ruin the fun!); once these premises become "widely accepted" the next perfectly logical step, as Mr. Savulesco points out, is that newborn babies can also be put to death. Opposition to these ideas then becomes a fanatical attack on the "values of a liberal society." It is obvious to any thinking person that there is no end to the horrible evil that can result once we have started down this path. If we do not turn things around soon there will be hell to pay. There is one consolation though...Dr. Mengele would have been awfully proud. Rabbi Moshe Averick is an orthodox rabbi, a  regular columnist for the Algemeiner Journal , and author of Nonsense of a High Order: The Confused and Illusory World of the Atheist . It is available on Amazon.com and Kindle. Rabbi Averick can be reached via his website. . 95 Comments For the same reason killing sick babies is immoral -- which is the same reason that killing healthy (or sick) adults is immoral: because humans live by learning to use rational judgment, which means they need to be free to pursue their own interests. That means that it is immoral to initiate force against any human individual. Remarkable. The a-theists are as zealous and rude as some of their theist brothers and sisters. Well, this is no surprise. Accept for a moment that women can and do terminate their pregnancies. Now, accept that women keep their babies through term. Finally, accept the illogic in killing one's newborn after carrying it through term, all 39 weeks, without the early in-utero termination. What, she had a change of mind? She didn't know she was pregnant? So you are suggesting that the responsibility of terminating, or birthing, or killing the baby are not the parents'? Or that one can just change one's mind about such a minor issue? Or is it selective (Oh, I'll keep the fetus through term but then kill it...) If a woman, specifically, has the werewithal to terminate her pregnancy, or carry it out, then should not her willing act of killing her child be as responsible? Should she not be as responsible for the murder of her child? I'm not discussing the ethics or terminating a pregnancy, I'm discussing the legality of killing a human being, at least in the US. Think about it. A body without a spirit is a corpse; a spirit without a body is a ghost. Actual living human beings are neither of those, but rather integrated beings for whom there is no reason to consider body and soul to be somehow in conflict such that you need to choose one or the other (instead of accepting both together as they actually come in real life). Check out Ayn Rand's description of the fake conflict between the "mystics of spirit" and the "mystics of muscle." Rabbi Averick, since you are correctly condemning an academic piece of writing for advocating infanticide, it would only be proper and sensible to condemn the Bible at the same time, since it is also a piece of writing advocating infanticide (and lots of other murder). Thanks Moshe for bringing up this subject. I have checked this out on the bmj website and I am heartened by the responses to this journal's defense to publish the article. There are still some people around who know what is right and what is wrong. Without reading all the posts, it seems that the article and the bmj are roundly condemned for writing and publishing it. For me this article is a clear sign that the present science education is totally blind on moral issues. Mankind will reap the fruits. Nice to hear from you. The problem is that these two "ethicists" and people like Singer and Tooley haven't changed their minds, and as long as they keep spewing out this garbage the danger is still there. And if they don't, some others will. As long as there are people who deny the existence of spirit, there will be some who follow the logic to the bitter end. Singer sees no difference between animal and human being because he denies that the human being is a spiritual being with an individual destiny. Cows and pigs don't have individual destinies. An animal you can kill as you see fit, and as humanly as you like. The 'spirit' issue, I fear cannot be solved merely with Biblical faith. That the human being is the carrier of spirit individuality has to be recognized directly. Once you know, Biblical scripture confirms it and is confirmed by it. You are right in pointing out that materialism is incapable of producing a morality that considers the human being sacred. Materialism is spiritual suicide, with some genocide mixed in. The fact that I could behave monstrously but don't doesn't scare me at all, and confronting the notion that evil action is open to all humans seems to be a good motivator to support the desperate, enact just laws, and adequately fund police forces and mental health services, not to hide under the bed and think "it could be me next". Maybe Moshe's scared that God will order to him to commit genocide, like He ordered Saul, or oblige him to kill his own child, like He obliged Jephthah. jp, the reason you are not scared is because you haven't quite taken stock of what is going on around you. The problem is not laws, Nazi Germany also had laws. The problem is who is making the laws. George Tiller, who murdered thousands of late term babies is a hero to many. Recently it was revealed that the authorizations he received that the woman were in imminent danger were of course phone (big shock, eh?) In the Netherlands they are now proposing mobile Euthenasia services. They already murder newborn babies and many old people, what is next? Your childish comments about Saul and Jephtah not only reveal your ignorance of the Torah but that your focus is on the wrong issues. Since you are rightfully condemning an academic piece of writing for advocating infanticide, it would only be proper to condemn the Bible, too, since it is also a piece of writing advocating infanticide (and lots of other murder). Moshe, you need to improve your reading comprehension. I didn't say the problem was laws, I said that the universal potential for evil was a motivation to make just laws , rather than hide in fear from our own capacity for evil actions. But since you're feeling all superior, perhaps you could share a lesson on how Jephthah's daughter had it so much better than other murdered children. Perhaps you're busy wondering about the fact that your model of the world predicts that atheists should be scared of the implications of evil and yet real atheists come here and tell you that they aren't. Why could that be? Could the model be.... wrong? No, banish the thought. It must simply be that you have a far better understanding of atheist thought than atheists themselves. Yes, that MUST be it. Glad we got that one sorted out, then. I am not quite sure why you are comparing people who kill their own children out of convenience to the rules of a nation engaged in war with another nation (especially when that other nation, the Amelekites, started the war unprovoked and with the intention of committing genocide. Regarding Jephthah, who in the world said what he did was an admiral thing? Its always been considered one of the most terrible and tragic stories in the Bible. The ancient Rabbis clearly state that fulfilling his vow vow was evil (and totally unnecessary for that matter). I'm not comparing the morality of killing children to the morality Saul's genocide orders. I'm merely speculating as to the source of fear that one might be next to commit evil acts that Moshe talks about. Because Moshe doesn't understand atheism, and thinks it implies amorality, he thinks that atheists must fear doing evil because they have no divine yardstick for what's right and wrong. (And if atheists by Moshe's definition are amoral and don't even know what evil IS, how can they fear committing evil acts? Moshe's argument is totally incoherent, as usual). On the other hand, the Torah records instances where people who were just going about their business were pressed into evil actions by God. In the case of Saul's soldiers, even Biblical apologists like William Lane Craig (admired by Moshe) worry about the traumatising effect of that order on those soldiers, who were ordered to go way beyond self-defence and slaughter babies and livestock as well as enemy soldiers. In such a case, where one has ceded moral control of one's life to God, it seems that a fear of being pressed to immoral acts by a higher power is a realistic fear, and it's only in the context of not having moral sovereignty over one's own actions that this fear even makes any sense at all. Suggesting that it's a problem for atheists just seems like projection to me. Same goes for Jephthah. He acted out of a sense of obligation to God, even when that went against his own moral sense. You can argue that the Torah calls his actions unnecessary, but the fact remains that Jephthah felt obliged to God to act as he did and felt the fear that Moshe projects onto atheists. If Jephthah had been an atheist, he simply would have had no reason to fear doing something evil out of obligation to God, and his daughter would have lived. A&A, you raise a good point I hadn't considered in this context. When an aggressor starts a war, then that aggressor is morally responsible for all the resulting deaths. The defender is not responsible for deaths on the aggressor's side, not even the deaths of children resulting from legitimate acts of self-defense. But my understanding is that the Biblical God was prone to killing unbelievers just because He didn't like them (not because it was reasonable to consider unbelief as an act of war). Humans have 46 chromosomes, which all the DNA of that person is stored in. Sperm cells and egg cells (gametes) have only half that number, and thus only half of a human's DNA. It's not a human, it's just part of a human genome. You think that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a newborn child. You've argued this before, and you seem very convinced about your position. Now Minerva and Guibilini write that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a newborn child, and you're wetting yourself with rage, even though they agree with you. If you had half a brain, you'd be praising their logic, and using it to push your anti-abortion agenda. But you don't have half a brain, so you're kicking at and tearing down the very philosophers who could best support your position, for the crime of agreeing with you on the moral equivalence of abortion and infanticide. Personally, I think you're exactly as wrong as these two, but if you want to spend your energy ripping people who agree with you a new one, then knock yourself out. The confused and illusory world of the theist can engender a lot of foul-ups like that. People who hold the false premise of equivalence between abortion and infanticide/homicide haven't necessarily decided whether they are for them or against them. Still, infanticide/homicide should properly be illegal, while abortion should properly be legal. They don't need to be taken as a package-deal. Communism/Naziism was an evil ideology that favored murder for the sake of "the good of society." (Or still favors it in the guise of Obama's death panels.) Biblical religion is an evil ideology that favors murder for the sake of "the glory of God." (Modern Western religions have retreated in the face of the Enlightenment and decided they could forgo that part of their doctrine for now, but other religions are still lost in the lust for killing.) Communism/Naziism was an evil ideology that favored murder for the sake of "the good of society." (Or still favors in in the guise of Obama's death panels.) Biblical religion is an evil ideology that favors murder for the sake of "the glory of God." (Modern Western religions have retreated in the face of the Enlightenment and decided they could forgo that part of their doctrine for now, but other religions are still lost in the lust for killing.) Here's an idea I think may have considerable merit -- geared to Alberto Giubilini, John Harris, Francesca Minerva, Julian Savelescu, Peter Singer, Michael Tooley, and all of their big-brained ilk. Anyone who thinks a newborn has no moral right to life because it isn't a sentient human being with goals and aspirations . . . should herself have no right to life. Then, would it be murder if someone deliberately killed them? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Ultimately, this could prove to be much ado about nothing. Since newborns have no moral right to life, we have a simple solution at hand. However, it will take a bit of time to bring my solution into effect. All it requires for implementation with a clear conscience is casting off the notion that non-person newborns have a right to be free of pain. Castrate all male newborns and it won't be terribly long before abortion, after-birth abortion, and infanticide cease to be nuch of a concern. You can thank me later. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  I'm not much of a religious person myself, but I do have one prayer: God spare me from encounters with militant atheists. The folks who aren't satisfied just not to be religious themselves, but who spend a lot of their time knocking people who are religious -- and their religions, too. Rabbi, your exchanges with this "salvage" character have made my surfing day -- so far. The dolt thinks she's a Child of the Enlightenment? Hardly. She rarely manages to complete a post without making some or multiple mistakes in usage. Funny, being called a dolt by someone who begs mythological characters for stuff isn't much of a burn. Probably because they clearly don't understand much about reality, that's why we can safely dismiss their opinions on abortion and when life starts. And you mistake "knocking" with pointing out how little sense it all makes but I understand why doses of truth would be upsetting, bit like feeding a lactose intolerant a milkshake. Please read this. It is a response from the editor of the journal in which the essay was published. "The novel contribution of this paper is not an argument in favour of infanticide -- the paper repeats the arguments made famous by Tooley and Singer -- but rather their application in consideration of maternal and family interests." "Many people will and have disagreed with these arguments. However, the goal of the Journal of Medical Ethics is not to present the Truth or promote some one moral view. It is to present well reasoned argument based on widely accepted premises. [...] The authors proceed logically from premises which many people accept to a conclusion that many of those people would reject." "Of course, many people will argue that on this basis abortion should be recriminalised. Those arguments can be well made and the Journal would publish a paper than made such a case coherently, originally and with application to issues of public or medical concern. The Journal does not specifically support substantive moral views, ideologies, theories, dogmas or moral outlooks, over others. It supports sound rational argument. Moreover, it supports freedom of ethical expression. The Journal welcomes reasoned coherent responses to After-Birth Abortion. Or indeed on any topic relevant to medical ethics." You are not quite correct. "The fetus or embryo as a child", merely younger than the neonate or toddler" is a strictly scientific position held by many ob-gyns even Bernard Nathanson MD (deceased) former board member of NARAL, though it can be a religious view as well. From that, abortion is seen correctly as pre-natal infanticide and you go from there. Under what circumstances may you take innocent life? You say a fetus or embryo has not been born. He or she also has not done any of a great number of other things. What makes birth special? A baby is not much more viable after birth than before. Breathes on its own, yes, but otherwise just lays there and cries until it can't anymore and then just lays there and eventually dies. Unless someone provides for him or her. I'll spot you everything you say about the Bible and none of that alters the scientific fact that what dies in an abortion is a child. One of the frightening aspects of religion (note the similarity to some of modern academia) is the self-righteous manner in which the religious leaders build a case for the murder of babies, even whole cities, etc. In fact it is the deadly logical consequence of the theistic worldview in which human life has no objective value but only as much value or non-value as is subjectively assigned to it by God, depending on who He considers proper believers or not. As I have said elsewhere, ANY time you devalue human life you can do desperately evil things. Including when you believe you are God's slave so if you are ordered to slaughter infants (Numbers 31:17) or strap on a bomb jacket or "Kill them all, the Lord will know His own," why then, you will because you have no intrinsic value. This article fails by its own standards. THE SILENT SCREAM contains real time ultrasound film of a 10 week abortion. The baby immediately goes to the top of the uterus, swimming frantically. Pulse is twice normal for a baby that old. Clearly the child values his life and feels sorrow- read "bright terror" for its ending. So by their arbitrary standard, that baby is human by their stated ceriteria. And they are Nazis in all but name. Mengele is closer to us today than you might think. My website mentions his checking up on tall poppies in the field of Mind Control research, but in 2002 when he would have been 92. This short guy with a videocamera toting minder peeled off a glove, grinned and chortled through his still gap toothed mouth...( the 79 skeleton and skull was a shill) poked me with his bare index finger in my Adam's apple, and was notable by his bone diseased reduced height (6 inches shorter...osteomyelitis and spongi....the cause) still strong brow and gentle jaw, and the cheek lines on his face were then so very very deep and ingrained...I wondere if caused by pain of his spine, or the programming he has to be kept scared of...for you see, Mengele as mind control programmer and Ipsimus without full responsibility for his lifes work, might lack mens rea for the trial he should have had were he not sequestered by western agencies. Still, that pain..the face lines, mans he was suffering even if he was quick escaping me realising what was going on. No, it's just that your articles are is so badly laid out with the images out of proportion to the text that flow and legibility suffer. It's odd, algemeiner is really well designed (well navigation can be a bit wonky) the coding is tight yet you can't seem to use it properly. Oh, and the joke isn't funny, the comparison cheap and it betrays the author's ignorance on more than a few subjects. At Any rate it's simple, what happened in a woman's womb is none of your business. I know, I known women are inferiorior and the ruinatin of mankind for tempting Adam but still it's their body that's a fact. I also know that this article has been getting misogynistic Bible (and Torah) beaters all hopped up thinking, once again, that they've found some sort of rhetorical silver bullet but alas they, once again, fail to note that different things are different. It's simple, if the woman wants to have a baby than it is a child, if she does not want the baby than it's a fetus. Hence CHOICE. See if you decide that a six week year old fetus is a person than why not the eggs and sperm? They're just as potential life as the fetus. It's so weird that theists are often anti-abortion/choice considering how many children their gods have slaughtered. Oh not just in the Angel of Death / flooding the world / blowing up a city way but in the poor design of the birth canal and whole fetal development process. You have a chance for miscarriages in the first trimester so often that people don't bother to announce their pregnancy until after. Tell me Mushe, is that your god doing some aborting on its own? Perhaps getting the next Hitler? And that's WITH medical science developed in the last 100 years or so, before that having a child was a most dangerous business for both mother and baby. Tell me Mushe, why did your inteligent designer make it so? Does it enjoy the site of a dead baby hanging out of it's dead mother? I know, I know, punishment for Eve and that darn magic fruit, women are here to suffer your angry god's wrath. Right, I forgot, sarcasm and irony is another thing you don't understand. That list is so long it's easy to loose track of what's on it. Is it truly Algemeiner's editorial policy to debase the evils of the Nazi regime to the point that cutting someone off in traffic is akin to liquidating the Polish ghetto? At any rate the god you worship and beg favors from is an abortionist on a scale that a million Planned Parenthood clinics could even begin to touch so it's a bit odd you bring so upset about dead babies. I guess abortion is only kosher if you're a mythological being rather than a rape victim or a woman who has this crazy idea that she should be master and commander of her own body. I know, I known if she's pregnant and doesn't want to be she's a slut who deserves what she gets. I'd like to point out to you that the article is about 'AFTER-BIRTH ABORTIONS", something that the Nazis performed with incredible skill and gusto and certainly was not outlawed in Germany. I think you are suffering from "neuro-phobia" which means "fear of using your brain." No you theist addled clown, what this whole exercise in retardation really is is a false comparision. Twits like you never address the actual realities of abortion, here they are: 1 It's none of your f&@$ing business what a woman does with her womb. I know your Bronze Age mentality leaves you with little choice but to regard women as chattel and breeding stock but we in the modern world, we children of the Enlightment think otherwise and have even gone as far as codifying it into law. 2 You are not pro-life you vile hypocrite of the worst sort. This whole publication is drooling at the idea of fresh war in the Middle East and I am sure you count yourself amongst the other hawks. If you do call yourself prolife it's only life in the womb, once the birth canal is cleared you couldn't care less. 3 you are not anti-abortion. If you truly thought it bad you would be part of the movement to ensure that birth control and sex education are widely available because that is the only practical way to reduce abortion. Abstinence education simpy does not work. 4 what you actually believe us that women who have sex unathorized by your bizarre god and its celestial barkers are whores and sluts who deserve to be punished with a baby. The idea of women having sex and "getting away with it" is what really motivates you and tripe like this post. 5 it's fascinating how you and idiots like you get upset at anyone comparing Israel to 80s South Africa as wild hyperbole but cheerfully compare slavery and the Holocaust to abortion. It makes me wonder, again, are you really that stupid or really that hypocritical? "It's simple, if the woman wants to have a baby than it is a child, if she does not want the baby than it's a fetus. Hence CHOICE." That is sheerest nonsense. Either you value human life, or you don't. If you don't, that's your choice, but you should admit it and own it. Abortion is ugly enough, but for any sane person (especially those who've held a newborn in their arms) the idea of killing babies after birth is repugnant and an atrocity. Thankfully here in the US we consider that murder, just as we consider it murder when an unborn baby is killed by violence against the mother. Those laws are very unlikely to change. We will see about abortion in the long run. I will take some comfort from the fact that you have to live with yourself. That can't be easy. No, not sheer nonsense, reality. I guess some people have trouble understanding that. See a fetus in a womb isn't actually human life, potential human life to be certain but so is a sperm and an egg and so is a zygote. A baby on the other hand is a human life, it's strange you can't tell the difference, perhaps you should google it? Oh and if you think making abortion illegal would stop it than you're a bigger fool than Mushe. See the war on drugs for an example of how it's impossible to legislate what people do with their own bodies. And if your really think abortion horrible than I assume you're all for free birth control? Moshe, Another gem! It always tickles my funny bone when people shout free speech after proposing something repugnantly evil. One common thread is the conclusion that if an objective standard does not exist then all opinions are somewhat equal. A preference for murdering babies and a preference for the color blue are more or less the same. One of the frightening aspects of religion is the self-righteous manner in which the religious leaders build a case for the murder of babies, even whole cities, etc. In fact it is the deadly logical consequence of the theistic worldview in which human life has no objective value but only as much value or non-value as is subjectively assigned to it by God, depending on who He considers proper believers or not. "In fact it is the deadly logical consequence of the theistic worldview in which human life has no objective value but only as much value or non-value as is subjectively assigned to it by God" There are many problems with your statement here, Steve. First of all, if you posit a God, then the value he assigns is scarcely "subjective". You are not expected to understand God's will, after all. It would certainly trump your pitiful and limited human understanding. Second, if you're an atheist (another form of faith and speculation by the way) there is certainly no "objective" value to a human life. No value system has more merit than any other, since no one sits in judgement and there is no absolute moral framework. That is one of the major tenets of the Left and the pro-abortion faction -- and the exact factor that leads to specious logic such as "infanticide is acceptable". As I pointed out in my first reply, atheism is as much a leap of faith as is religion. Most fair-minded people will admit that the orderly Universe we inhabit leads one to believe that it was conceived rather than just a random accident of physics. For instance, why are so many power laws inverse square laws rather than inverse d^1.8948382 laws? Further, isn't it better to feel a sense of meaning in life rather than the empty pit of meaninglessness? Aside from all that, from a strictly practical standpoint the Judeo-Christian tradition has clearly produced the best rules for nurturing a successful society. One of the most central tenets of those rules is a reverence for human life. It is difficult for me to think that anyone considers a baby to be anything but a full-fledged human. Any biologist would say a baby is a human. It is also laughable how many people will gleefully support this flavor of mass murder -- while bemoaning even the mistreatment of a dog or cat. "As I pointed out in my first reply, atheism is as much a leap of faith as is religion." That's a common misconception. It does take a leap of faith to choose to have theistic beliefs, since there is not only no evidence for anything supernatural, but the supernatural is literally impossible. Being an atheist on the other hand merely means not taking that particular leap of faith. That is, instead of taking the leap of faith to become a theist, an atheist doesn't take it. (That doesn't mean that atheists cannot take other leaps of faith. For instance, another common leap of faith is the belief in government as God , that government spending, for instance, can stimulate the economy.) "Most fair-minded people will admit that the orderly Universe we inhabit leads one to believe that it was conceived rather than just a random accident of physics." That's nonsense. There is nothing "fair-minded" about that false "supernatural vs random" dichotomy. The universe actually exists. Why people should believe they need some sort of explanation for it is the problem in that regard. "Further, isn't it better to feel a sense of meaning in life rather than the empty pit of meaninglessness?" Sure it is, but the "empty pit" of theism is not a viable source for dealing with how to get meaning in your life. Believing in "something from nothing" or "meaning from nothing" is not a wise choice. "Aside from all that, from a strictly practical standpoint the Judeo-Christian tradition has clearly produced the best rules for nurturing a successful society." That's not true. It was the Enlightenment that did the job -- by progressing beyond the old religious traditions. What God did, from KJV I Samuel 6:19: [19] And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. What some others did: Of course, in Nazi Germany the premise that Jews were a mortal threat to the Aryan people was also a "widely accepted" premise and genocide was practiced in Nazi Occupied Europe and Russia. This column is not about Bible study, so I'm not going into discussing the actual story from a Jewish perspective, but quit living in the past. You are talking about events that happened 3000 years ago. No S for Bs, I wasn't expressing amazement at your math but rather your dismissal of genocide because it happened a long time ago. Tell me when can we dismiss the Nazi version? We're well past three generations now, that's a kong time in our lifespans. To be fair your god is a silly myth that stupid people think is real so it may not be quite the same thing. AS I tried to point out to Steve Stoddard, this column is not about Bible Study. In fact, in Jewish tradition the report of thousands of people dying is not taken literally and has been understood metaphorically. The simple fact is that Jews do not go around murdering people and we do not teach our children to be hostile to the cultures around them. A fundamental principle of Jewish law is "Dina D'malchusa Dina", which means that wherever a Jew lives he must accept the laws of the country that he is in, and it is a religious obligation to be an upstanding citizen. The only exception is if the country requires him to violate the Torah, say for instance...by murdering newborn babies. In truth, all of this is beside the point. Are you outraged that these "ethicists" advocate murdering babies or are you not? Where do you stand? More... A friend of mine called me the other day sounding very distressed.

HI	The Post-Interview Thank You Note Making it Count By the Monster Career Coach Are you waiting to hear from an employer after you've interviewed with them? You can increase your chances of being chosen for the next round of interviews -- or of being offered the job -- by following up professionally. This includes writing a customized thank you note. The purpose of this often neglected bit of communication is threefold:  to remind the interviewer(s) how much you really want the job  to address any issues or gaps that may have arisen during the interview  to demonstrate that you are willing to go the extra mile, since many job hunters don't bother to send such a note (or send amateurish ones if they do) Every time you go for a job interview , ask each person you meet for their business card . This way you will know their exact names and titles and can send them an appropriate thank you. E-mailed notes are fine. For that extra special touch, consider sending an actual hand written card or note. Here is an example of a typical thank you e-mail: Dear (name of person who interviewed you), Thank you very much for taking the time to interview me on Tuesday afternoon. You gave me quite a bit of insight about your organization and were very courteous and professional. I particularly liked the way you made me feel comfortable from the start. As we discussed, my five years of experience as an Accounts Payable specialist make me an excellent choice for the position we talked about. At one point you asked if I had any additional experience that would be relevant to the job. I would like to add here that I currently serve as a volunteer Accounts Payable supervisor for a local charity. I would really welcome an opportunity to return for the next round of interviews. Please feel free to contact me at the number and e-mail address provided below. Sincerely, (your name here) Keep your thank you's short and sweet. Send them around two business days after you've been interviewed. Then cross your fingers, keep up your job search momentum elsewhere, and hope for that thrilling call-back.
OP	Thursday Playlist: While She Sleeps Cancer Bats? - R.A.T.S. "I love Cancer Bats and their album 'Dead Set On Living' does not let them down. It's an amazing follow-on from 'Bears, Mayors, Scraps and Bones' and my favourite song is probably, 'R.A.T.S. Those guys have got a lot of respect from musicians in metal and whatever other genres, they are a great bunch of dudes and their band is awesome. Their live show is also great, it's got energy without being pretentious or over the top, it's four dudes rocking out." The Suicide File? - Twilight "I found the band years ago and have listened to their albums sing. The aggression and the sound of the band are what brings me towards them. When I was a younger kid I was really into metal, then I started skateboarding with a group of friends who were really into hardcore, they switched me on to this kind of vibe and I was drawn to it immediately. I discovered a lot of bands all around the same time as I was a mixtape guy then and I used to put twenty bands on a CD and then blast it for days." Black Rebel Motorcycle Club? - Weapon of Choice "I love dark driving music and this is moody as shit. I saw them in 2001 on a small tour, it was a bit indie but I loved their attitude and swagger. It's hard to describe exactly why I like them, guess it's just rock and roll." Every Time I Die? - Revival Mode "Just a sick song on a sick album. I still think the best way to find music is through other people and that was another band that our guitarist Mat bought to me years ago, I'd never given them a chance before he gave me a CD, after that I was sold." Sick of it All - ?Scratch The Surface "I think I saw them first on TV and I'd seen them a few times at festivals without really registered who it was. The whole band backs SOIA heavily, we also saw one guy piss into another guy's mouth in a Sick Of It All moshpit once but I'm not sure if it was in Europe or the UK. We couldn't stop talking about it for ages after." Cancer Bats? - Road Sick "How much I still mosh at shows depends on how much I've had to drink, if I've had a few beers and if it's a band I really like thenyou might see me in there. I definitely got busy when Slipknot played at Sonisphere, me and the lads got involved in a serious pushpit, we also got onstage with Fred Durst when he called all the girls up. Not sure why. Usually if I resepct a band I always like to go down the front and watch from there, and for some reason I always end up doing an embarrassing stagedive at shows and split my jeans.??" The Hives - ?Walk Idiot Walk "I used to love this band as a kid, they had a brutal moshpit in 2003 and the memory of that night stuck with me for so long. I saw them at a festival last year and it didn't live up to my memory of that first show I saw, they are still cool and their music is still incredible, I'm gonna have to go see them again basically!"

IN	Would you like to come to Myspace? Tuesday 09 October, 2012 Launched in 2003, Myspace -- one of the founding social media sites, became an instant hit with millions as a way to share photos, music and also as a way to connect with friends. Since then, users of the site have been in decline as Facebook and Twitter have taken the majority of the market share due to trends having shifted to instant updates. The likes of Facebook and Twitter have also embraced comments from their users and as a result, are designed very much with usability in mind. In 2010, Myspace attempted to revitalise itself in an attempt to compete with the other social media giants, launching a new brand and some minor, but much needed updates to the website. The homepage was promising, with bold, unconventional, blocky shapes which stood out from the dull repetitiveness of other social media sites. The only real gripe was the full page images that encase the content. At first glance they look good, but then you realise you're staring at a giant full page advert -- a nod to the difficult times at Myspace HQ. Once you entered however, it was the same old layout (seen so many times before) but not done quite as well. The logo refresh was a nice idea in principle but it always looked a little awkward -- especially with the various versions floating around, some with the word 'space', some without, which showed a lack of confidence in the logo. Overall the rebrand and new site were unsuccessful due to the company failing to roll it out the whole way. Fast-forward to 2012 and another attempt by Myspace to break back into the social media lime light. This time, they appear to have done it properly! The new logo is a much more refined and modernised take on the original, and the overall feel is far more sophisticated and confident. The original logo has been updated with subtle rounded corners, and has been shrunk to fit in line with the text which helps the logo flow much better. The new website is the most drastic change and if it ends up looking like the proposal video, it will position itself far ahead of the likes of Twitter and Facebook in design, by a long way. The focus has been moved towards photos and music, playing to Myspace's strengths, and its new integration with Facebook and Twitter will help the company work alongside them rather than competing directly against them. If this website goes ahead as planned, the Superdream team will for sure be firing up old accounts and jumping back on the Myspace band wagon! How to...

IN dtp	The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its output. Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer who must maintain it. Every non trivial program has at least one bug Corollary 1 - A sufficient condition for program triviality is that it have no bugs. Corollary 2 - At least one bug will be observed after the author leaves the organization. Bugs will appear in one part of a working program when another 'unrelated' part is modified. The subtlest bugs cause the greatest damage and problems. Corollary - A subtle bug will modify storage thereby masquerading as some other problem. Lulled into Security Law A 'debugged' program that crashes will wipe out source files on storage devices when there is the least available backup. A hardware failure will cause system software to crash, and the customer engineer will blame the programmer. A system software crash will cause hardware to act strangely and the programmers will blame the customer engineer. Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited. Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. Make it possible for programmers to write programs in English, and you will find that programmers can not write in English. The documented interfaces between standard software modules will have undocumented quirks. The probability of a hardware failure disappearing is inversely proportional to the distance between the computer and the customer engineer. A working program is one that has only unobserved bugs. No matter how many resources you have, it is never enough. Any cool program always requires more memory than you have. When you finally buy enough memory, you will not have enough disk space. Disks are always full. It is futile to try to get more disk space. Data expands to fill any void. If a program actually fits in memory and has enough disk space, it is guaranteed to crash. If such a program has not crashed yet, it is waiting for a critical moment before it crashes. No matter how good of a deal you get on computer components, the price will always drop immediately after the purchase. All components become obsolete. The speed with which components become obsolete is directly proportional to the price of the component. Software bugs are impossible to detect by anybody except the end user.

IN NA dtp ne	PHOTOS Meet THE HOSTS MTV NEWS ARTICLES Jocelyn Vena, MTV.com Photo: Jason LaVeris/Getty Images Despite being in one of the hottest bromances in the world of pop, One Direction confirm that their pal Justin Bieber won't be featured on their November album release, Take Me Home . Harry Styles broke the bad news to the U.K.'s The Sun , sharing, "There is no Justin Bieber on the album." The 1D guys and Bieber first sparked rumours of a duet earlier this year when they tweeted about hanging out in the studio together. But 1D denied it to MTV News , with Liam Payne sharing, "We actually went down to the studio to listen to some of Justin Bieber's tracks. He invited us down and we had a good listen, but there's no real collaboration or anything." Even though Bieber won't be on it, the guys have been working with lots of other A-listers on Take Me Home, including British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran, who also worked with the guys on their debut album, Up All Night . "I wrote the three tracks that I gave [them]... when I was 17 and they were on my hard drive for a long time," Sheeran said. "And then I gave them one song for their last album, and they came back and said, 'Do you have any more?' and I said, 'Here's a whole load. Take your pick.'... Seventeen-year-old Ed just wrote a lot of love songs, so expect to hear a lot of love songs on their album, I guess." Ahead of the November 13 album release, the guys will officially drop their single, "Live While We're Young," on October 1. The guys are currently riding high off their three wins at the VMAs last week, as well as their star-making debut performance on the show, when they delighted fans with their single, "One Thing." Are you looking forward to One Direction's next album? Let us know in the comments!
NA OP ne ob	You must go blind in one eye before NHS will treat you Thousands of patients will be condemned to blindness because of a decision to ration the NHS treatment which could save their sight, leading charities warned last night. They said that patients with macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly, would effectively have to lose the use of an eye before qualifying for therapy to save their remaining vision. Their condemnation came as the NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommended restrictions on funding a treatment for the condition. Macular degeneration affects two million people in Britain. One version, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), can mean loss of sight in the affected eye within three to five months of diagnosis. It is the principal cause of irreversible blindness in Britain but the sight of many sufferers can be saved at a cost of around 1,500 per patient if treated early enough. AMD is caused by blood vessels growing under the central part of the retina. When they leak fluid, scar tissue forms and vision can be destroyed. Photodynamic-therapy (PDT) uses laser light to activate a drug, Visudyne, which seals the blood vessels and stops further damage. It is routinely available in most European Union countries and in North America. The treatment has been available in Britain for 18 months at 100 hospitals and 500 patients have been treated. But now NICE's ruling says Visudyne should be used to maintain vision in only one eye in cases of age-related macular degeneration - either the better seeing one or the remaining functioning one where sight has been lost in the other. The AMD Alliance, a group of six charities including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Macular Disease Society and Age Concern, condemned the decision as 'outrageous'. Steve Winyard, of the Royal National Institute of the Blind, said he was appalled, claiming the decision amounted to saying that it was acceptable for people to go blind in one eye. He estimated that around 1,500 suitable patients would lose out each year. 'This recommendation is outrageous. If upheld, NICE is burdening doctors with the task of telling people that they cannot receive treatment, despite there being an effective therapy available. 'A few people with wet AMD will be able to buy sight in their first eye through private treatment, while those on lower incomes will go blind. 'This wholly unacceptable and needs to be challenged. We know that a number of patient groups plan to appeal this decision and allow more equitable access to this sightsaving therapy.' He argued the costs to society of someone losing their 'Condemned to Russian roulette' sight far outweighed the costs of the treatment. Robin Hill, of the Macular Disease Society, was also disgusted. 'Despite the fact that we have an effective treatment, NICE wants to limit the number of treatments given by the NHS and is recommending that PDT should only be offered to those patients who have already lost the sight of one eye,' he said. 'Patients whose circumstances compel them to rely upon the NHS will be condemned by NICE to Russian roulette for their one good eye. 'An accident or a sudden haemorrhage, or failure to get a clinic appointment within a matter of days, may take away at a stroke life's quality as they know it.' He added that he agreed with critics of NICE who argue that, in many cases, new treatments are being held up simply to save money. There is growing concern that the body, set up to speed up the use of new drugs and treatments, has actually made it more difficult for patients to get care routinely available in other European countries and the U.S. Novartis, the firm which has pioneered Visudyne, said it had no doubt there was ' sufficient evidence' to support the routine use and funding of the treatment on the NHS. There could not be any question over its efficacy and safety, which has been recognised by health authorities around the world, it said. British trials of the treatment, carried out more than two years ago, showed of 600 patients in 22 centres, including Royal Liverpool University Hospital and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, 61 per cent found their condition improved or stabilised.
NA sr	Berbatov -- If you love him, let him go When the rumour that Berbatov's departure from Old Trafford was imminent took flight, we witnessed perhaps the biggest love-in that the striker has had since he joined the club. It was so great that you wondered whether Berbatov had hauled us to the title single-handedly, and felt a bit sorry for James Collins. When Berbatov arrived, he joined a strikeforce also consisting of Ronaldo, Tevez, and Rooney. The quartet were almost never deployed together, though Ferguson did use them as a 'nuclear option' on occasion -- they were tasked with destroying Tottenham when we found ourselves 2-0 down at White Hart Lane, and the result was the best, most exciting half of football we'd played since the 7-1 versus Roma. Everything gelled that day, and United's fantastic four looked to be in serious contention for the title of 'greatest strikeforce ever put together.' It really did have everything -- physicality, work-rate, irresistible pace, guile, technique, and with all four being able to produce magic and score goals. It turned out to be a false dawn -- Ferguson, in his caution, or wisdom, rarely used all four together, and the last time we saw the combination was in a futile pursuit in the dying stages of the clash with Barcelona in Rome. Berbatov, however, stuck around, and improved in successive seasons but has still not found his place at the club. Having fallen foul of Ferguson's refusal to play him in bigger games, his confidence has wavered, and he has also bizarrely failed to attract the unconditional admiration of the fans enjoyed by the likes of Rooney. It's hard to imagine a player scoring a hat-trick, involving an overhead kick, to defeat Liverpool and attracting such limited reverence. And so, I'm prepared to admit that in a pragmatic light, a move makes a lot of sense. PSG were the club rumoured to be making the bid, and a moneyed club short on success would be ideal, as it would mean we'd get good money for an ageing striker who has never fitted into our system, and has plenty of young replacements waiting in the wings. Yet if we sell Berbatov, we will lose something more valuable -- we will lose our swagger. Berbatov fits into a category of players that has, under Ferguson, included Scholes, Ronaldo, and Cantona -- the player who gets people off their seats. Nani may be capable of the spectacular, but people are reluctant to vacate their sofas when they know that the outcome is more likely to be a shot wildly blazed into the stands. Berbatov, like the other players named, not only has the capacity for magic, but there's also the very high probability that when the ball is moved on, we'll be in a better position than we were previously. Yes, contrary to the doubters' views, Berbatov is reliable. Rooney would be our spark if he could be trusted not to give the ball away with a leaden touch or a floated, searching pass to the linesman. And it's the unpredictability we'll miss -- ways of scoring goals we hadn't thought of, rather than a small repertoire of simple goals which can at times find itself quickly exhausted Still, Ferguson's European record in recent years makes it difficult to question his judgement. Berbatov was unlikely to have been key to either Champions League defeat to Barcelona, and perhaps his style of play really is at odds with the modern game -- too slow to put pressure on an opposition backline, not energetic enough to close down midfielders. Instead Rooney has been moved to this role, a player with half of Berbatov's imagination and reliability with the ball but who never neglects his defensive duties. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the closest player to Berbatov around in terms of style, fell out of favour at Barcelona for similar reasons, and success has eluded him at the highest level in Europe. So perhaps there isn't room for imagination anymore. Sheer imagination is no longer for settling tight games between giants, but for unlocking the massed defences of Birmingham and Stoke. The genius who would formerly be the inspirational, talismanic presence is now a squad player to be used in a specific situation. It's happening elsewhere too -- Ronaldo and Messi have been more effective as they have become more flairless, and Barcelona, the greatest team of our age, have a passing game not modelled on the swagger and fearlessness of the great Brazilian sides, or the patience supported by magic of Italian masters, but rather the robotic uniformity we label as boring when practised by Germans. It's a painful thought, but if Berbatov wants to be back playing his best football, playing the best role he can for a team, then he should leave. There are plenty of clubs that would be ideal for him, but sadly, United, and anyone else with notions of European dominance, are not one of them. It'll be sad to see him go, and the memories will remain, but Dimitar -- I just want what's best for you. Great article Callum. It must be painful to write some home truths about a class player who has been unfairly maligned over the years. But you have set out the salient issues really well. To the illustrious names you can add Riquelme as well whose like you wont see again as a slow but thinking creative midfielder. It's a different games we play today. Dimi remains a class act. I hope he can stay on and contribute in the way he has. His attitude is first class and should be applauded despite the constant criticism he receicves from the naysayers. It's a squad games these days in any case. But I can understand the psychological blow of knowing you're not going to be in the strongest starting XI. From united's poitnof view they will be thinking of the resale value and perhaps also how much room to give the younger and faster strikers a chance to shine. Great Post Callum. All I can is, I will always love Berba for his attitude and respect for our club. He has well and truly endeared himself, but despite this, there are still some shameless people who have no time for him. I agree with you completely . He should be let go. 15mil or whatever it is is a lot of money for a player over 30. He isn't getting any younger, and he deserves to spend the last few seasons on the pitch -- not on the bench. Good article but i disagree! I think Berbatov still has a vital role to play this year, i just don't think the likes of Macheda and Welbeck will perform well on a consistent basis, and as much as i love Michael Owen let's face it he is still injury prone, i think Dimitar gives us something unique, we would be mad to sell him! Great read and well debated but i would disagree! I am not bothered in the slightest about the 15 million for him at his age as that is Glazer money and they got 80 from Ronny. We do need Berba with his swagger and your right he does get me off my seat but that has to be the same for Nani. Nani can frustrate but every player with that ability does the same as it is impossible to do it every time. Nani was the best player in the prem last year it was a joke Bale won footballer fo the year. Berba despreatey wants to play for United and we should make the most out of that, look at City with all their mercenaries like Balotelli, Yaya etc all signed and stated they would retirn to their former clubs in 4 years! Very good read. I think the question is really about the style of the team as a whole, and the legacy that surrounds it. I don't agree that players like Berba are outdated. We have traditonally relied on wingers, box to box MFs and a 4-4-2 geared for savagely quick counters. You could fit in Berba and Nani, but then what do you do with Valencia and Fletcher? You could buy, say, Pastore, and build a delightful team around Pastore, Berba and Nani, but then would such a team win the PL? As I have said, earlier that it's no coincidence that Le Arse have come closest to beating barca, and the same team struggles against the likes of Stoke. I disagree about Europe though -- I feel that's exactly where Berba, and not Hernandez would have some real impact, if played consistently. So to me, it's about priorities, legacy and future vision. i really hope Berba plays a lot more this season. It is only right to give our top scorer some playing time. the man has been a good servant and has endured a lot of shit. He has to be rewarded by Fergie at some point. Berbatov has done no wrong -- it's just his style of football cannot suit most games that United play or face up Imagine the urgency of yesterday's game, whether you like it or not, it'd be ugly to lose to the Noisy Neighbours -- would you prefer the urgency of the likes of Cleverley or maybe Chicarito to Berba's slow turning left and right and probings? I'm not against Berba, I'd love him to weave some magic the way our past heroes did -- better still to use him that occasional time But for consistency and guaranteed challenge in a league like BPL -- do what we do, not what the ignorant and idealistic Wenger does... Berbatov WILL start a lot of games this season hopefully. Hernandez isn't just gonna walk straight into the team when he comes back now is he? Trust fergie berba will play a lot. Fergie is not a wicked man. he just tries to play the line- up that best fits the situation. I mean Berba had his best season EVER at United last year so that's a good sign. I'm amazed and pissed. Let Berba be for fooks sake!!! He is flair and creativity personalized. He doesn't play football, he plays football. He does it with speed and makes it look like slow-mo. The best bit...he scores vital and plenty of goals. After Rooney there are only Chica and Berba. After them there are Welbeck, Macheda and an injuryprone Owen. Welbeck didn't convince me last night. Macheda had a mediocre season in Italy and I'm not sure he is up for it. Berba has the head to sit out 2 out of 3 three games and still perform his magic when he gets the chance. He has the heart of a devil, and want to stay and prove himself for those dumbnuts still doubting him. Give him a new long-term deal and keep him for life! berbatov provides something different and like all our players, he will be used in rotation. thats what gets us the PL and CL final.. quality in depth, allowing us to have an extraordinary team even when we have multiple players out with injuries, fatigue etc. berbatov has never acted like he wants to be the focus of our team, he plays like he wants to be part of the team. and that is what the best squads need.. If he does leave then I hope the young lads rise up and fill in the void, as he may be slow on the ball, but he has excellent control skills, and I think it was a CL match in which he did a Marseille Roulette and humiliated the opposition defender, followed by a brilliant pass for goal. But however, he was inconsistent sometimes, and may be why SAF decided to keep him out of the CL and in the match yesterday. Good article Callum. I agree, a move would most definitely benefit Berba in terms of playing time but I don't think the move would benefit Manchester United in the slightest. The only youngster who has currently earned having a shot ahead of Berba is Wellbeck, in my opinion. Injuries are bound to reartheir ugly head, particularly where Owen is concerned and I wouldn't be suprised if the joke that are the FA fabricated a few more "united exclusive" rules to issue bans. If We're in need of back up I would be far more comfortable having to call on Berba than Diouf or Macheda right now. Brilliant article, but I have to say that am praying that Berba stays, he is a class act. The 15M+ is a lot of money to turn down but we have to remember that apart from Rooney and Owen, all our other strikers are still novices in the EPL. In addition, we have already lost 5 players (VDS, Scholesy, G. Neville, Sheasy & Wes Brown), this number will most likely be 7 if we add PIG & the G Bomb, I think if Berba is added to that list, 8 players will be too much and SAF has always been a believer in continuity. Pretty good article from Callum. But I don't believe that Berbatov doesn't have a role to play. He definitely does. Just like Sheringham did even when Yorke, Cole and Ole were on fire. However, and here comes the sad reality, he might be better off elsewhere simply because he will always be underappreciated by the fans and dare I say the club as well. It's not just the C.League final snub. It's the fact that he wasn't included in the player of the year poll that the club itself organized. It's the fact that David Gill basically said that he was on trial this season. It's the fact that yesterday he was brought on in the 89th minute. For what? Just for him to take a penalty? I don't believe the situation will get any better for Berba since I have the feeling that SAF wants to give the likes of Welbeck and Macheda every possible chance of making it. So as much as it pains me, I think selling him could be the best solution for all parties at the moment. As for Sir Alex not starting him in the big games, I wouldn't blame that on Berbatov since we usually revert to 4-5-1 in those games. If Berbatov loses his spot to a 3rd midfielder, then that says something about the weakness of our midfield, not Berba's. The only time a striker took his place in big games, was Hernandez in the latter half of last season. Costas @ 10:04, Spot on mate. I think we had this discussion right after the CL final as well where we decided that moving on would be best for all parties and especially Berbatov -- for the treatment meted out to him by some of our fans. I completely agree that he will have a role to play against the Stokes and the like. I don't want him to leave and wish he could end his career with us. But as a big fan of Berbatov, the player and human being, I think it would be better for him to not take more dents on his confidence by moving to a place where the club and fans will actually appreciates his uniquenss. Excellent article, but I don't really agree. I thought Fergie made a huge mistake not having Berba even on the bench for the Barca match, while keeping Owen (whom I like, so don't get me wrong) who merely replicated Hernandez's role but in a less effective way, while Berba would have offered something very different.. What Berba gives is not just flair and creativity he also holds on to the ball all over the pitch better than anyone else in the team barring Scholes, who has of course now gone. If you watch what Berba's up to when he hasn't got the ball you'll see how much hard work he does, finding space, dragging defenders away, giving options. Overall he works far harder than he's credited for, including tackling and defensive headers at free kicks/ corners (It's an aside but if he'd been playing yesterday City would not have scored their first -- United had a terrific record defending set-pieces last season, some of which was down to Berba.) Of course I wouldn't hold onto Berbatov as a defender, but he does so much more than float about being languidly 'creative', and he would have made a big difference had he played in the Champs Lge Final. It would have been much harder for the 'robotic' tik-tak attackers of Barca to get their carousel going if Berba had been there strolling about with the ball tied to his feet, giving all his team-mates a breather. Berba buys time for a team like few others currently at United, enabling the slow-slow-quick movement which is so effective in the PL, and could be sometimes in Europe if Fergie only gave him the chance. Berbatov is a UEFA Cup Class A player? Sorry but whoever said is a Class A [something]. Whatever word fits that slot. All actual competitive games in a season is a big game. Does it mean that when SAF plays Berbatov the team can afford to lose? Or do you reckon that he thinks Berbatov is only good enough for certain "levels" of teams? Unless you could ensure ceterus paribus, in which every team plays the same tactics but with different players, that is just nonsensical conjecture. There will be times when some other players are just not on form and can't make things happen no matter how hard they try. Stop believing the media just because they say so. A player who is really not in SAF's plans is someone like Gibson. Not considered part of the squad, not even present for the Community Shield game. Berbatov will continue to make some of you eat really humble pie this season. A top footballer who is as irreplaceable as Scholes was, for his ball control as a target man is insane. I could never ever agree with those wanting him out. To think i wasn't even all that interested in his deadline day signing in the first place! Very good article, enjoyed reading it. I myself see his days numbered. Costas has already said what I was going to say. To reiterate considering his devotion to the club he gets treated like shit generally speaking. Berbatov is like Jesus gets on with it despite all the flack. I get the feeling he's being forced out. However, when does Berbatov start acting like the player who has all the qualities you mentioned. If anyone else had been in Berbatov's position after finishing as top scorer and being left out of the CL final, they would've demonstrated a holier-than-thou attitude, and been entirely right in doing so. But what does Berbatov say -- That it was his fault that he was not good enough to make the team. I sometimes wish he wasn't Mr. Nice Guy (The same I always feel about Rahul Dravid -- The Indian cricketer). Being a nice guys isn't always going to be as much of a rewarding experience as we could hope. Just ask Wayne Rooney how not being one has been like after last season. My gripe is that a player with the talent and attitude that Berbatov has should be rewarded by a club as honorable as ours. But I don't think that has always happened with Berbatov. Fans have always treated him like vermin. The club hasn't shown the same kind of respect to him that he has. That is why, even though I think he will be critical to our success this season if he stays, for Berbatov himself, it would be better if this nightmare ended. Berbatov is a top quality striker and absolutely fulfills the roles given to him by Sir Alex and our tactical team. There is zero chance of him being sold. He is irreplaceable. Further, it is not in Berbatov's interest to leave, and he confirms that. Dimitar is far better suited to an elite squad of superstars competing for the highest accolades than to some also-ran bunch of hopefuls. His place at the main table is secured, he does not want or need to throw it away. " I had assumed the comments here were about what I posted at 10.55, but I may be deluded. I often am..." Lol.....Sir If you of all United fans are deluded, then we might as well all pack up and leave Excellent insightful comment from you above....I must also congratulate you on that wonderfully written article on Cantona's redemption. I read it up later because I was a bit busy then. A fantastic read as always. I have said it you before, why don't you make a collection of these articles and publish it. You're style is very lucid and absorbing....or better still write a book and pass down your tremendous knowledge and experience of How To Be a True Red through all the myriad times, in victory and defeat, in glory and in tragedy. I'm sure a few of our so called fans who keep slagging off our own players who have been more active on here lately will have plenty to learn from your writings In fact All True REDS can learn a lot from those because the younger ones over the last 25 odd years have grown up spoilt with trophies and do not truly appreciate the exciting times that we live in. You raise an excellent point about how spoiled we have become as United fans, especially the younger generation.... In a way we have been blessed mainly due to the genius that is Sir Alex. I still recall the times during the late 70?s and 80?s when our season would be defined on how far we got in the FA cup or how well we did against the dippers in the head to head clashes..... I do wonder at times as to some of the so called fans of today and think to my self, how many would have lasted the course! Cheers mate...although I belong to the younger lot myself, when I see Sir Alex constantly reminding us about the history of Manchester United, about the babes and the depressing times that followed as well as the writings of people like Sir Giles, it really makes me wonder whether we've gotten too used to the winning and title run-ins and Champions league finals... I mean screw Barca, there were times when we were relegated for God's sake and people say its the worst squad and worst midfield ever... Funny eh, how some even dare complain about the squad or when they moan about certain players calling them crap etc! I was old enough to remember when we were relegated, but not old enough to feel the pain. What I do recall is that my dad had the worst summers of his life that year, it was only years later that I understood why he was so depressed then.......... Success does breed success and I for one love it, however my love for United was and is never about trophy count well argued must say but I've gotta disagree Callum. Berbatov had his best season since signing so it doesn't make sense selling him now. He gives us something we dont have, and he's a confidence player so even if the supporters dont appreciate it, he knows that the history books will. Dimmy played a huge role in our historic 19th and that will give him a self worth and swagger we've been waiting to see. I think this will be his best season in our shirt. Even yesterday when he came on and cut the ball back running into the box, he looked sharp, decisive and hungry. Welbeck is good enough to replace Berbatov right now, but with so many games coming up it would be short sighted to only have Rooney and Hernandez as our only week in week out proven goal scorers. Extra competition wont hurt our young strikers this season, time is on their side after all. Dimmi should have at least one more season. No player is irreplaceable. You can't go like for like, sometimes, but you can still manage the situation. Different formation, or different way of playing. We didn't replace Keano like for like. Fergie went a different way, with the signing of Carrick. I've already said, if the Berb is happy being 3rd choice striker, then why should begrudge him staying another year? I think if he does stay, he could get more games, than some people think. It's a long hard season and a player of his invaluable experience, might be crucial in the home straight of the season. WillieRedNut @ 12:37: " if the Berb is happy being 3rd choice striker, then why should begrudge him staying another year?" Yeah, right, It's only money -- 90,000 a week -- BUT it seems to me that the decision to play Danny Welbeck in the recent "big friendlies" (against ManShitty and Barcelona) was a managerial decision about determining if Danny Welbeck would be the "3rd choice striker". Danny Welbeck passed the test with flying colours so it should follow that if Dimmy were to stay then he'd be the 4th choice. The business-of-footie is all about "what have you done for me lately ?" SAF is many things but sentimental is not one of them. Or am I missing something ? This link is a series of snapshots -- the real thing happened in real time. Look at the number of ManShitty defenders behind the ball in # 4 -- six, by my count -- and see how they were sliced-and-diced by absolutely fantastic interplay, AT SPEED, involving Nani, Rooney, Anderson, Tom Cleverley, and Mr Danny Welbeck. The kids are alright. I know it's not my money. What I'm trying to get at is the thinking by those who are tasked with spending and team-building. 90,000 a week for a "4th choice striker" -- insurance ? or valuable player ? the managers have to make a choice, he can't be both in the world of Glazernomics -- is a lot of money. A LOT OF MONEY. Watching SAF build the team -- moving the pieces ("assets") around -- is a fascinating topic. His record over the years has been fantastic but he's not always right -- just mostly-right. If his past behaviour is anything to go by then one would imagine that whether (or not !) Dimmy is a "big time Charlie" will have no bearing on the OldFootieKnight's decision-making. SAF is like a shark -- he's got to keep moving. So, change is the only constant. And, of course, A LOT OF MONEY is always going to be a consideration when determining if he shells out 90,000 a week for a guy to be the 4th-choice striker. I'm not saying that he might not do it -- Dimmy does offer those silky skills, he does provide "insurance", he does provide experience, and he is very professional in his demeanour. What I am saying is that when you take into consideration SAF's previous willingness to ruthlessly cut ties, then it sure seem more likely -- than not -- that Dimmy is going to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. If that happens will the saved-wages go towards paying a huge packet that WeeWes trousers every week ? Will SAF try to use Dimmy as a make-weight ? Or will SAF's flinty character save the Glazers more money ? It's not MONEYBALL but, then, the business of sports isn't a fans' wankfest. disagree 100% don't get rid of a world class striker who's prepared to be a squad player,as i've mentioned before berba doesn't rely on pace so age isn't a factor he could play for another 4 or 5 yrs easy.he isn't going to lose his skill and what does 10mill buy nowadays?.berba is arguably the most skilful player at the club. Fuck me this article is made for all the berba haters to come on and gloat,denton were are you.Will not be visiting this thread again,won't be able to handle all the shit that's going to be written. I'll say it again how can a top scorer,voted mom more than anyone,have most match winning goals,not fit in? what berba produces on the field is contradictory to this article and all the other shit that comes from berba haters mouths. Dimitar Berbatov is the reason i lost fantasy football last season. After the hattrick and the bicycle kick, i vowed that i will never take him out of my side, and will always be the captain until the end of last season. Why? Simple. His bicycle kick against liverpool is the fantasy of fantasy. We've always prided ourselves on giving the youngsters a chance, I think Danny deserves a shot tbh. Seeing as we sold JOS (for a ridiculously low transfer fee!), because his wages were quite high for a benchman, I think the same rule might apply to Berba. He offers us variety and another dimension- and if he was on 50k a week, I'd keep him for that reason. But unfortunately he's not. In any case, I don't think Berba is suited to the role of squad man. He seems to be at his best when he's got a regular run of games to keep his form/confidence up. He's not like an Owen or a Solskjaer who can not play for a few weeks, and still do the business when they're called upon. I think I'm right in saying Berba only scored twice in the last 3 months of the season? He was scoring for fun when he was playing week in week out, but once he lost his place, his rhythm disappeared, and most of the games where he was brought in, he struggled. Bloody good article Mr Hamilton. I admire your bravery for highlighting the fact that Rooney despite his work rate and defensive qualities does at times have the midas touch, if indeed Midas is a middle eastern suicide bomber. Not delicate I'll think you'll agree. Berbatov is class, he's infuriating because of his swagger and leaves us with head in hands after a 2 yarder is missed with the keeper the other end of the goal mouth BUT there is no other player in the world Id want instead of Berba with the ball at his feet with 4 defenders around him waiting for the strikers to get into the box. What I love about most about Berba is that when a ball looks to be going out of play a defender will just assume the ball is going out and like Manchester United in the last second he carries on play, turning on a sixpence and balancing the ball on the touch line to deliver a killer pass. Pure class. smartalex -- luckily sir alex doesn't think he's irreplacable...it's blabbering because it's load of shit because he isn't, and that's a fact...he was more out of the team then in when we played our best football last season in the most important matches..he's good against uefa cup sides at best -- he's useless or he's not involved mostly against top sides like chelsea,barca,arsenal,inter bayern etc... and that's not my hatred nor anger saiyng, that's a FACT but i say keep him as a back up striker when we need to unlock some average sides Nice article by Callum -- I'll confess that similar thoughts have been playing around inside my head. Even a year or so ago, I was saying that the Berb should think about leaving -- for his own sake. It's to his credit that he didn't, and given his contribution to last year's massive #19, we should al be grateful that he didn't Several posters have made good points -- SmartAlex, Willie and Balaji among them -- but I must pay special thanks to Giles for his wonderful post at 10:55. Thank you for expanding the discussion of Berbatov's role beyond the cosmetic. His contributions around the pitch have long been neglected and glossed-over. I wonder if that's the impact of TV? It is devilishly difficult to gain a full appreciation of a player's contribution -- especially his movement and his contributions off the ball -- from watching on TV, because you are only ever watching an isolated portion of what's happening. I know of at least one top level coach who refuses to watch football on TV for this very reason. It's one of the reasons I try to be restrained in my comments and criticisms of players -- because my own viewing is limited to TV, and is therefore truly limited. But The Berb's contributions off the ball have long been praised by SAF, who apparently knows a thing or two about such matters, and I am pleased to see Giles point out these aspects of The Berb's play. If you understand football -- I mean really, truly understand the sport, as opposed to being someone who is merely titillated by the occasional "trick" or stunning goal -- then you must surely agree with the significance of what Giles is saying. I think The Berb should stay, and I hope he does. As I've said repeatedly, I haven't seen any problems with Berbatov's interaction and combination play with young players like Nani and Hernandez. And we don't know where injuries, form and the various ups and downs of a season will lead us. CedarsDevil says: I think the blabbering could be described as with out Berba we would NOT have won the league last season...... that doesn't mean he's irreplacable, he's nowhere near the most important players in the team Oh, and I do wish people would stop pretending they are United's Chief Financial Officer. Discussion of whether a player justifies his salary (or worse, his transfer fee -- which doesn't even go to the player), or whether we can afford it or would be better off spending the money elsewhere, is the lowest form of argument. Why? Because it's an argument that requires detailed knowledge of two different areas -- the club's finances, and its football operations -- and not one of us on here knows enough about either side of it to make that call. Almost invariably, it's an argument trotted out by those with an ax to grind about a player they don't like, in some sort of attempt to present a rational reason for why that player should be sold (or not bought). And yet, if you don't know about the club's finances, and you don't understand football the way SAF understands it, then you basically talking shit, so how rational can it be? Someone doesn't like Sneijder -- well, we can't afford him (er, how the fuck would you know?). Don't like Berbatov? We could use the money better elsewhere (er, you mean, on someone that YOU prefer?). I especially like the argument that he's earning too much for someone who's not a "starter" (given that Sir Alex's continued, heavy use of squad rotation means we have no more than 4 or 5 "starters" anyway). It is the epitome of everything I despise about about "playing football manager". No-one who makes that argument will ever be taken seriously by me (not that that would sorry them, anyway!). Thanks for the mention StatesideAussie! It is always good to be appreciated. Mostly, I just get attacked for defending our club against unwarranted attacks! A road I choose, and walk with vigorous determination, undoubtedly drawing ire from those who consider their rights infringed by my defense of absent heroes, legends and members of our great club. Their aggressively attended put-downs and epithets worry me not. They are most welcome to transfer their vile hate away from United and onto my rather broad shoulders. However, we all like praise when it is deserved. Lads U think your missing the point behind Dentons posts, i for one wouldnt want Berba to go I think he is class and completely agree with what Wayne states above but the point Denton is making is why keep him in SAF's eyes if he is surplus to requirements? Danny has played more pre season and yesterday was a huge indicator in SAF's eyes that Berba doesnt fit into his new system. Lets not kid oursleves as as much as i love Berba's best first touch in world football he didnt even make the bench in what is the biggest game in the world yet that fuckiing mickey did? He's not surplus to requirements though. He's still at the club? As for Denton posts on Berbatov, there's no Grey area. We all know how feels about him. My point, and other peoples points is, the guy is still here and the manager has dismissed any suggestions, that's he's for sale. Until that situation changes, I don't see any need for discussion on his future. For the record, no offers on the table for Berbatov. No auction, as I see it either. to add the point on being surplus as well is that Owen advises the boss has told him he will play a more vital role, The Pea and Rooney are first choice, Wellbeck looks to have been given the nod so without the boss saying your not wanted at what point do you say Berba doenst fit into SAF's plans? @giggs12 hi mate said i wouldn't make another comment but you dragged me back in.lol dentons been bashing berba for a few years mate,just at present he has a platform to preach because berba isn't getting much playing time.i mentioned on a different thread it makes sense for wellbeck to get alot of playing time in pre season,sir alex can take a good look at the lad,i don't take it as a indication wellbeck is ahead of berba in the pecking order at all. Sir Alex called the berba leaving rumors rubbish,gill has come out and said berbas going nowhere and yet everyone who wants berba out choose to ignore this.same as the glazier haters calling sir alex a liar about having money to spend,even now some choose to say club is broke although its spent 50mill mindboggling really.these people don't look at the whole picture just take facts or statements and distort them to fit their way of thinking .there has been only positive vibes from the club about keeping berba yet still all this negativity WillieRedNut @ 15:42: "As for Denton posts on Berbatov, there's no Grey area. We all know how feels about him." Actually, you don't know how I feel about him. I'm not a "BerbaHater" but have become a "BerbaSceptic" as he has -- in five out of six half-seasons -- flattered to deceive. BUT I have come to the conclusion that he's the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. I have never slagged him for being "lazy" and have ignored his "petulance"; I have always praised his "silky skills" and "fantastic ball control". I was very enthusiastic about his signing a few years ago but I have been increasingly sceptical at his ability to dovetail with TheWayneBoy -- and that was highlighted by the way that Chicharito literally ate Dimmy's lunch in the second half of last season. I was disgusted by the way that TheWayneBoy (and Mr Stretford) went about re-negotiating the contract but the way that it was resolved made it perfectly apparent that SAF values Rooney above all his other players. What do you think SAF's reaction would have been if Ruud or JaapStam or Keane-o or Carlitos did something similar ? We know what his reaction would be because he was perfectly will to dispense with them -- and Paul Ince and Mark Hughes and Kanchelskis and SirDavey, as well -- when they were no longer part of the program. BUT -- and it's a hugely significant qualification -- it was SAF who caved in and feathered TheWayneBoy's bed. This digression is relevant because if TheWayneBoy is the key player then the "others" gain (or lose) importance in their ability to dovetail with him. Chicharito does and so does Danny Welbeck but the evidence suggests that, in his view, Dimmy doesn't. Of course, I'm "reading his mind" rather than giving credence to SAF's utterances; I don't deny that because in all professional sports it's rather more important to follow-the-money than to read the managers' lips. Wayne @ 15:56: "dentons been bashing berba for a few years mate,just at present he has a platform to preach because berba isn't getting much playing time." That's just not true. I welcomed his transfer in 2008. When Ronaldo and Carlitos left in 2009 I wrote that it was time for the Dimmy/WayneBoy axis to fulfil its potential. I wrote the same thing last summer -- after TheWayneBoy's injury in the spring of 2010 had thwarted our CL and EPL aspirations and Dimmy hadn't been up-to-the-task of taking on the sole responsibility of providing cover for him. It could be argued -- and I didn't nay-say -- that Dimmy was crucial in the first half of last season BUT he was effectively marginalized when TheWayneBoy hit form after the new year and Chicharito took playing-time away from Dimmy. And, I have to say in my own defence, that since the turn of the year I have not been "basking Berba" but, rather, providing a critical/sceptical analysis of his role in SAF's plans. I don't mind your disagreeing with me -- but, please, get your facts straight. And try to be a bit more subtle in the way in which you characterize my position. @giggs12 lol doesn't take much mate,these kind of threads bring people like CROoney out of the woodwork,my only way to show restraint is by trying to ignore them,just have a hard time dealing with these kinds of people without getting angry @denton it seems like 2 years,if its only a year sorry about that,subtle is definitely a word that wouldn't be used to describe me.Cloak it anyway you want, berba skeptic instead of berba basher go ahead.never seen any positive berba posts come from you.any chance you're all over the lad,so i'll stick to berba basher in my eyes thats what you are. Ohh come on, cut Denton some slack....he is hardly the typical trolling berba/gibson/carrick basher now, is he? He doesnt think Berba has what it takes at Utd these days (from a playing style perspective), or reading from some of his clarificatory posts, doesn't believe Berba has what SAF demands, and on evidence, could well be right on that ground. Whether we agree or not is an entirely different manner. Having read your comments on RoM and elsewhere for a long time, I am well aware of your love for our Club. I know you to be fair and supportive, and what I'm about to say should be considered in that light, and known to be specifically on topic. - At 16:03 you say: ever since finding out in the concourse at Wembley he (Berbatov) was ommitted from the squad I find it hard to see how SAF figures him in - At 16:07 I say: Perhaps you can apply your opinion of Park being left out of a CL final, yet still playing a big role, to your quandary expressed at 16:03. Asked and answered. Then, in response, at 16:15 you say: since then Park has really shown up in the big games. That implies that Berbatov should show up in the next big game after the CL final, which therefore adds weight to Sir Alex' decision to retain the quality forward. I'm not sure I agree about the "reliability" of Berbatov's passing compared to Rooney. In almost every department Rooney is a superior player to what Berbatov is. Excellent footballer that Berba is, he's never reached any type of consistency a Utd. 20 goals last season is his best return, but 13 goals came in 4 games. That says it all about him for me, he's completely unreliable, and untrustworthy. Fergie has clearly lost his trust in him, as was shown towards the end of last season (compounded by his dreadful appearance in the FA cup semi final). If we were offered 18m, for a 30 year old striker with a year left on his contract, we would be stupid to turn it down. On the flip side, respect to Berbatov who has never moaned, or bitched about not being in the team. The snub for the CL final was harsh, and to be honest didnt make any sense, but he has been completely professional in dealing with it. Fair play to him, but for me, he has never been good enough for Utd on a regular basis, and I'm not convinced he ever will be now. Denton ... my comment wasn't aimed exclusively at you, but when you start talking about whether a "4th choice striker" is worth 90 grand a week, and Glazer-nomics and all that stuff, then you are playing CFO. It's as simple as. If Sir Alex thinks Berbatov is surplus to requirements, then he'll go. And if Gill or the Glazers or Sir Alex collectively decide 90 grand is too much for whatever role Berbatov plays, then they'll act on it. My point is that passing an opinion on a player's footballing contribution is one thing; but passing an opinion on the club's budget and salary structure as well, is another thing entirely. Especially when it involves assumed knowledge that none of us are equipped with, and is then offered as a "reason" why the player should be moved on. It's apparently not enough to say "I don't think this guy is a good enough footballer for us", people have to try to make it sound much more objective by saying, "I don't think he's that good -- and we certainly can't justify keeping him (or buying him) at that price." And to present that as an argument, and then claim you are somehow not playing Chief Financial Officer, is bollocks. @jeet point is denton been banging on berba for some time,nothing to do with what's going on right now.Again no indication from the club berba is done quite the opposite so why are we having these discussions because of fans like denton who want him gone. North Stand Tier 2 ... I wonder, if I quoted some stats back at you (like Berbatov's shots-to-goals conversion rate last season, which was virtually the same as Chicharito's and twice as good as Rooney's), would you then be one of those who say, but stats prove nothing? Lies, damned lies and statistics, and all that? Not saying you are, but I have run into it before with others. I do respect your comments about the CL final, however. And I am on the fence about accepting a good offer for The Berb -- in the end, every player must have his price, the only question is, what is it? Cheers Sir Alex Ferguson doesn't trust Berbatov in big games. Fair enough, the proof is in the pudding. Berbatov was given a chance in last years FA semi, he missed a good chance (even David Villa has missed sitters), but instead of 'getting on with it', he suffered an on pitch 'melt down'. Berbatov has himself stated that he prefers the creative withdrawn role. There-in lies the problem, that is Rooneys prefered position. I wouldn't like to see Berbatov leave though. He HAS become a more effective player for us. He LOVES our club, and if Rooney fell victim to injury Berbatov would be my first choice as supporting striker. wayne ... lol. I guess that's what you have to expect when you're the only United striker to ever miss a chance in an important match. He's obviously not up to United standard, so I don't know why you keep defending him. 1) I think Denton has it spot on- in that Rooney, whether we like it or not, is Fergie's Number 1. So it's all about who works best with him. That's not opinion, that's fact. 2) Nobody can question Berbatov's talent or attitude. But all of a sudden, when people give their OPINIONS on him, if it isn't 100% positive....they become a "Berba hater?" Do me a favour! When he's playing for Utd, then I'm sure most people on here (bar a few trolls) are supporting him all the way. But does that mean we have to believe that everything is rosy, and that there's no negative points to any of our players? 3) "Surplus to requirements" might be an overly strong phrase to use....but the principle has some truth to it. Fergie clearly doesn't trust him for the big matches- that's not an opinion, that's a fact. Does anybody actually believe, that when we bought him back in 08 for such a hefty transfer fee and high wages....that this is how Fergie planned on using him? As a squad player? No chance, we all know Fergie intended on him being one of the core members of the side a la Rooney, Vidic, Evra etc. And for whatever reason, that isn't how its turned out. If you actually think he was bought to be a squad player who rarely plays in the big matches, you're fooling yourself. The fact that Park was in the same situation as Berba- 30 years old, a year left on his deal- and was given an extension....whilst Berba has effectively been put on trial, speaks volumes. Not really the best way to treat somebody who played such a massive role in us getting #19......but football, and Fergie in particular, isn't about sentimentality. 4) @ Stateside- "I especially like the argument that he's earning too much for someone who's not a "starter" (given that Sir Alex's continued, heavy use of squad rotation means we have no more than 4 or 5 "starters" anyway)."................See my point above. Berba was bought to be one of those core, almost undroppable players. Explain why JOS was sold, for such a low fee, if not for the wages? Because the 2 situations are very similar.............both JOS and Berba are 30, both players will have less opportunities next season due to the emergence of younger players, and both players were more than happy to play a squad man role. No I do believe in stats, and shots to conversion are important. But in my opinion, there have been too many games, particularly away from home last season, where Berba was anonymous. Ofcourse, most of our players were, and responsibility cant fall solely on Berba for that, but he needs to be able to take those games by the scruff of the neck and drag Utd forward. That's what Utd forwards have to do if they want to succeed. Lets make no mistake about it, if we play away from home like we did last season, then we arent going to win the league. Selling Berba doesnt solve that problem, but to me, if we can get 18m for him, and that gives us enough money to sign Wesley Sneijder, leaving us with Welbeck, Macheda and Owen as back up, its a no brainer for me... @smartalex -- didn't want to be rude, sorry about that. my bad...i guess it's a habbit because people are usually rude to me when i'm not showing my mesmeration about berbatov... as for SAF not saying that he thinks he?s NOT irreplacable -- are you fucking kidding me ? do you realise how stupid that sounds ( again no offense)...have you ever read between the lines or have you heard about the expression "actions speak louder than words"...let me draw a little picture here -- do you think that messi or ronaldo would live the same fate as he did the last season or ever since he moved to us ? would they be benched for the CL semifinals and finals as well as crucial games of the season ? no. why ? because they are irreplacable, they are one of the most , if not the most important players for their clubs.. why VDS wasn't benched for the CL final and for all the crucial matches ? because he's irreplacable or the closest thing to it...at man united there are no irreplacable players but players like rooney,vidic,evra and rio ferdinand are close to that and they are most important players of our club and almost an automatic selection...not only that berbatov is replacable, but he's replacable by michael owen according to SAF..he is a squad player who gets handy against average teams My opinion of Berba couldn't be any different compared to Denton's, but no need to put his opinions under the microscope. I think we know by now that the Berba issue divides us fans more than anything else. Like Jeet said, at least his posts are way classier than a lot of other stuff we've seen in this blog lately. Anyway, one more thing I wanted to add. I see a lot of fans say that we should keep him as backup. I don't think that will do any good. Fergie knows better than us that Berbatov is a player that relies a lot on psychology. Some may make fun of that, but it's the truth and he is not a rare exception. Cantona also required special treatment at times. Anyway, if Berbatov is convinced that our only use for him will be as a 3rd or 4th striker, I don't expect him to dazzle us on the pitch. That was clearly evident in the FA cup semi. A game that came a few days after Sir Alex publicly admitted that Hernandez took his place in the side. And when you've scored 20 goals until that point in the season and you realize that it's not enough to make the others believe in you, then it can be quite demoralizing. So if Berbatov stays and realizes that no matter what, Fergie would rather go with Hernandez, Welbeck or Owen, then there's no point in keeping him. Fuck me,how many times does Sir Alex have to say berba was unlucky and had nothing to do with his play???????????? Hernandez got red hot and Sir Alex left a out of form rooney in to get him back to form.Sir Alex doesn't trust him and thats a fact??????? its actually opposite from a fact its made up bollocks.All the negative points about berba is all hyperbole,stats and facts don't back up any of the negative points,just made up shit including utds desire to get rid of him. A great read, Callum summed up my feelings and stance on the Berbinator matter, we have 7 strikers at the club (3 unproven, chico's, 2nd season, with owen's injury record), on the other hand Berb is 30 and 18 million offer may be too good to turn down for a player that has never really commanded a first team shirt and has probably been treated poorly. His love for the club is undeniable, but l think if the offer is true, we should move him on and move on from there. @Costas hi mate we normally agree on most things have to disagree about berba coming off the bench,he made a impact lots of times coming on as sub to win utd games.I'm suprised someone as level headed as you would use the city miss to make a point,every top striker misses chances just like every top keeper lets in bad goals.Berba was a top player last year whether starting or coming on as sub,don't know were this berba needs special treatment comes from. Hi. I don't look at it as special treatment mate. It's different treatment and I used the Cantona example for that reason. I am not saying we have to use him all the time to keep him happy, but he has to believe that he has a chance of being a regular starter if he plays well. And I don't believe that can happen anymore. I hope I'm wrong. I don't see Berbatov as an impact sub. He's scored once or twice coming off the bench, but I don't think it's something he relishes. As for the City game, I didn't use his missed chances to explain why he's a flop or anything. But to me at least, it was clearly evident that he was carrying a huge burden on that day due to Chicharito's emergence. As if he had to prove himself all over again. Denton -- I said no Grey areas mate, on how you feel about Berbatov. You mentioned lazy and other aspects, not me. You say, you're not a Berba hater? I didn't say you were. If other people think that, that's their opinion. You don't give the guy much credit, from all your posts, I've ever read. So, maybe you're harsher on him, than other players. That's my opinion anyway. You were doubting Cleverley's ability to step up for United. Against city, he impressed many fans, including myself. Now on to Welbeck. He played well yesterday, but does that really mean, he leapfrogs Berbatov in the pecking order? I'm not sure about that. We all want to see young players given the chance to prove themselves at United. I'm no different to anyone else, in that regard. If an offer comes in for Berbatov and the club accepts that offer, I'll be content with the decision to sell him. ATM, no offer is forthcoming. @Cedars hi mate,the use of berbas miss against blackburn and city to prove points is just mental.Using the same theory,lets assume VDS flub against west brom cost utd the league would everyone be using that to say VDS isn't utd quality and can't be trusted? of course not so why does berba have to live with those two misses? Rooney doesn't have to live with missing everything in sight for the first 10-15 games of the season. People who use these type of examples to make reasons why berba isn't utd quality just don't want the lad here and it goes against all the stats.I don't understand why fans dislike him he does nothing but good things @Costas i just think you're wrong about his mental make up.Take into account all the things he's been through and yet he still wants to stay,if he wasn't sure they'd be alot of clubs banging down the door if he put in a transfer request.Berba must be comfortable in his decision to stay,think we have to trust what's going on in his own mind. -You said Berbatov is "useless in the most prestige competition" which is not true. - I said "He is irreplaceable." -- which is correct. The skillset that Berbatov brings is not presently seen in players that are available to replace him. His is an uncommon talent. - You then 'laughed your arse off' at that, and described my considered opinion as blabbering (foolish, mindless and endless) -I said you were rude, that you saddened me, and asked where you got your name from - you replied: a) "sir alex doesn't think he's irreplacable" b) "(smartalex is) blabbering because it's load of shit because he isn't, and that's a fact" c) "he's good against uefa cup sides at best" d) "he's useless" e) "that's not my hatred nor anger saiyng, that's a FACT" f) "but i say keep him as a back up striker when we need to unlock some average sides - I asked you to link me to SAF's quote saying that he "doesn't think Berbatov irreplacable". Or is that just your opinion? It turns out that is just your opinion. You've been broadly and specifically slating our opinions, and stating your views to be fact, when they are only your opinions. I've been politely stating my views and having your rudeness in response. Now you really take the cake: willie ... excellent response to Denton at 18:13 -- including the last bit about any offers that might be received and even accepted. I wouldn't like to think we are actively seeking to unload him. Like you, I love the rise of the young guns -- the next few years, or even the next decade, promises to be all kinds of exciting. But it's too early yet to be dumping our top scorer from the previous season. On the other hand, with any player, there's always the chance of a top offer being received. If the club gets such an offer for The Berb and decides to accept it, and if he is willing to go (considering he is still under contract for at least one more season), then I too will be content. (If that happens, though, i will still defend him against those who, once he has gone, attempt to tarnish his time here.) I didn't want to see CR7 go either, but we would have been silly to turn down 80m. Maybe so mate. Maybe I am underestimating his mental toughness. It remains to be proved I guess. The competition up front is a lot stronger than it was 12 months ago and he'll have to suck it up I feel. Unquestionably. Why ? He came for a record-high fee and with glowing expectations. And, for whatever reason, he just hasn't fulfilled those expectations -- well, he's been electric in one half-season (out of six). So, yeah, I expect that he has more to prove than someone like, say, Chicharito who was bought for "relative peanuts" (if you can call 6 million "peanuts"). Maybe my expectations were wrong but I don't think that the empirical evidence suggests that Dimmy has been much of a success at UTD -- one half-season out of six. Benched for all the important EPL and CL matches. Only rose-coloured glasses would suggest that he has met the expectations that came with his transfer fee and the relentless pursuit by SAF. Sparkz ... I don't think berba was bought to be "one of those undroppable players", as you put it. Remember, at the time we still had CR7 and Tevez, as well as Rooney. Rooney has never been undroppable, we all know that. And CR7 certainly wasn't undroppable. True, CR7 wasn't a pure striker, but in the year that Berba joined, that was essentially how he played. Berbatov has made over 30 PL appearances in each of his three seasons with us, including starting at least 60% of all PL matches in each season. That isn't the track record of someone who's thought of (by SAF) as a third-choice or fourth-choice striker. Now, I can just feel that some people are going to come back at me and say, "ah, but how many games will he get this year?" The answer is: I don't know -- and neither do you. Only SAF knows that, and even he may have his plans upset by circumstances. So we'll see. @Costas why would he stay if he had doubts,contray to alot of fans opinion of him he's world class and a top.top,player.not one club in the world wouldn't take him in his acceptence to be a squad player,he knows competition just got tougher but doesn't seem to worried about it.I'm in his corner all the way not just because of the fact i rate him very highly but also because of all the abuse he has taken while being at utd.most players would have been long gone,i have deep respect for him,he clearly loves utd To say that rooney is "a player with half of Berbatov's imagination and reliability with the ball" is a joke i think. While berb is an exceptional player there's no way he's more creative than rooney in my opinion. Think of it this way what would hurt the team creatively more, losing rooney or berbatov? I don't think that even warrents a response because rooney is the creative heartbeat of our team. While i'd obviously be very sad to see him leave if berbatov was twice as creative and reliable with the ball as rooney he would have been the first name on the team sheet against barca and would have been able to carry us through the end of 09/10 after rooney got injured. Come on Denton! Players don't decide the fee mate. You know this. Not a good enough reason imo. His goals helped United win the 19th title. That constitutes a level of success for me. Has he been a raging success, in his tenure at United? No. I'd be a fool, to suggest otherwise. I won't, however, consider him a complete failure. That's a media driven thing. They hate our manager and hate United's success even more. Berbatov is somewhere in between. All I ask of people is, support the guy, while he dons the Red shirt. Not much to ask, eh? Denton ... the transfer fee had nothing to do with him. If expectations were raised by the size of the fee, then it was the combination of Daniel Levy, Sir Alex and David Gill who are responsible for raising those expectations. I have always maintained that Sir Alex must have known what sort of player he was buying, and that The Berb's performance has at least matched his performances previously at Spurs, and last year exceeded them. And The Berb has always said he was embarrassed by that fee. It can't be the player's fault that he hasn't matched expectations that were raised by a fee that he didn't set, didn't agree to, didn't pay, didn't benefit from, and has publicly stated he found embarrassing. The only way the player can be responsible for any of that is if he was an asshole who simply never tried and obviously didn't care -- and The Berb has never been that. denton just making up berbas length of stay at utd, one good 1/2 a season out of 6,really does show how big your bias is against him,you accuse others of tunnelvision.that's pretty fucking rich coming from you. Gentlemen, its a long season, we will need all the players we currently have, including Berbatov, whose contribution many seem to have forgotten during the first half of last season while Rooney was injured/pissed-off/haggling, etc. The season is won over the long haul, having a strong squad is what makes the difference, and we all know who is best at this. Having the best first XI wins you the CL but having the deepest squad wins the PL. Do we need to improve the first....yes, we could, but lets keep the strong squad that's already there, what's wrong with competition for places. Cant understand why so many United supporters continue to place an asterisk next to Nani. He has to be one of the few players anywhere who is expected to deliver a perfect end product 100% of the time. So some of his shots balloon over the bar, passes go astray, but he still had the best delivery (assists) in the PL and voted player of the year by his own team mates. This is what you get with skill players, they will sometimes do stupid things, but they win you matches. His skinning of Arsenal left backs is priceless........speaking of which, weren't you just waiting to see a one on one with Nani and Gael Clichy yesterday NO NO NO!!!!! Terrible article. Erase. Shocking. To say a player who has just won the golden boot in the toughest league in the world can't cut it in Europe is nonsense. He might not be as quick as Hernandez, he might not have the toughness that Rooney does but the player is unreal. I personally think he has the most delightful first touch in world football. He's not and never has been and never will be the type of player who's going to drag us to a result in times of sheer adversity but when the red machine purrs like it should he's unstoppable. There's all the talk of sneijder now because Scholesy has retired but to be fair i think sneijder is the type of player we've been missing for more than just the forthcoming season and have we had that type of player i think we'd have seen a lot more from Berbs previously. He's worth keeping in my opinion. Although i can see the reasons for his sale if it were for good good money but i'm and fan of the football not the business. Mitko's/ that is how in Bulgarian family and friends call someone called Dimitar/ is so obvious: A CLASSICAL CASE OF THE JEWEL AND THE SWINE, I apologize in advance to Man U fans. He is a talent which appears once in a life time, a real genius, a real entertainer and a real gentleman. Man U and SAF should forever ashamed by maiming him psychomogically and in practice stopping him on the way to football's Olympus- togethere with Pele, Garrincha, Beckenbauer and the like. He should leave immeditale, he is alredy at the end of his career. He needs a team which should build its game around him, not use him as a crutch in various very dubious " schemes". * My view of Berbatov's mental make up is very similar to Costas. He wants to stay and prove himself because he loves playing for us and wearing the crest of Manchester United proudly. But, he is a "confidence" player -- like Ronaldo was. I've heard stories of people saying that after a particularly bad performances, some people had to speak to Ronnie and make him feel wanted. I don't think Berba is at that level, but I think he must feel that he is making an impact -- like Costas has mentioned. That is what I keep on banging about. As long as he was the focal point of our attacks, he was a brilliant player. And I've said this before also, once Rooney came back, Sir Alex went to back to Wayne like Denton mentioned. What good does that do to a player like Berbatov who thrives on confidence -- like most any striker but more so in Berba's case. Another aspect is of course, knowing Sir Alex, I think he would've discussed Berba's case with the player himself and made it clear how he features in his plans. If it is OK for player and manager, I can't complain. * I simply cannot buy into this notion of the price being right. To me the math is simpler than that: If Sir Alex wants to sell Berbatov, then it doesn't matter if it is 18 million or 8 million, he will ask David Gill to haggle for a decent enough price and off load him. If Sir Alex doesn't want to sell Berbatov -- like he has already publicly stated -- then no matter what the fucking price is, Berba is staying for good. It is as simple as that. The fact that Sir Alex will sell Berbatov if the "price is right" even if he finds him useful is absurd. * On that same note, if Sir Alex wants to sign Sneijder, then it will happen whether we sell Berba or not. The notion that Berbatov sale is going to be used a make-way for bringing in Sneijder is completely absurd. The two transfers are completely independent except the fact that both are dependent on what Sir Alex Ferguson wants to happen. The Glazers will not force conditions like that on Sir Alex's head -- simple as that. If Sneijder doesn't happen, it will be for a million different reasons, but that is not one of them. I for one will be very upset if he goes. He may not fit into our style of play, but he gives us a different option should our style not work in any given game. Also, he loves the club and has a deep respect for United rarely seen by a player who has not been grown and nurtured within the club. His mentality and philosophy is invaluable within the dressing room, Rooney could learn a thing or two from the Berb. Feel sorry for the fella. I think Callum has a point. How would players like Cantona, Di Canio, Le Tissier -- creative and imaginative forwards -- fair in todays game? Berbatov is very much of the same breed as these. Are the truly talented footballers getting boxed out a bit by the athletic alternatives. shebangsthedrum @ 20:45: "He may not fit into our style of play, but he gives us a different option should our style not work in any given game." Can't argue with that. And I'd go further than that and say (again -- I did say it in one of those post-match threads on ROM, the day after the CL final) that SAF made a tactical mistake in not selecting Dimmy for the bench in that game. BUT that's looking backwards and we all know that what's past can't be changed. About the fee -- yeah, sure, he didn't set the price but to say he didn't benefit from it is a bit rich. Doesn't the player get a cut from the transfer fee as well as a signing-on bonus/new contract from his new club ? Did his MrTenPerCent do his side of the business for nothing, too ? I know, I know -- Dimmy would have moved to Manchester for free because he loves "our club" and has wanted to wear the red shirt since he was a nipper; pull the other one, it's got bells on it ! Dimmy might not have "set the fee" but he did get a new, improved contract. And, yes, SAF must "have known what sort of player he was getting" -- but, I guess that TheOldFootieKnight isn't always 100% right, eh ? SAF thought he was getting CantonaRedux but got Matt Le Tissier. A cynic might say "History repeats itself, first as tragedy and then as farce" but I wouldn't. Good article -- but harsh on other players !!!! -- Rooney HAS imagination and his passing range is almost Scholes like, he can see out of the back of his head some times, he had a bad patch last year but he scored over 30 goals the year before that, he is versatile and never complains about where he is played, he has played on the left and first and second striker he is an absolutely phenomenal player, world class, admired globally and a league above Berbatov by any objective standard. Giggs, Nani, Cleverly, Scholes all have a great passing range and creativity and the twins and Evra and now Cleverlycan also pick a pass. saying these other players are predicable and somewhat limited or "boring" is bull shit. Move of the match at Wembly -- Welbeck, Cleverly, Rooney, Nani -- anyone who thinks these guys are not exciting to watch needs to think again, not to put him down, but they can do anything Berbatov can do. I would also put Welbeck on recent form above Berbatov. Owen as well for sheer goals ratio and finishing. SAF is clearly playing Welbeck as 3rd choice and Berbatov will be fighting for the spoils with Owen, Machaeda abd Diouf. People bang on about Welbecks consistency without even looking at how he has played all pre-season and giving the guy a chance, he is not too young to play -- look at how Pea established himself -- and Berbatov is not consistent and has never been consistent for United, he is good in patches. His confidence and finishing flucctuate and he can hit 5 or miss 10. I trust SAF and the manager , he is not a fool, he clearly does not rate Berbatov for big games nor see him as a regular starter bar when first choice players are injured -- he used Rooney alone as sole striker in big games post -- Ronaldo and when Chicarito arrived he moved Rooney to 2nd striker. The boss clearly does not rate Berbatov and I think the article does a good job of explaining why, he is slow and does not fit with United's style of breaking fast. He make a useful contribution last season and has some nice touches but he can be equally frustrating and divide opinion. Above all the young players deserve a chance, we have young strikers who look great and they deserve to come in to stake their claim, Berbatov has had 3 years to stake his claim for a starting place and failed and the Boss is clearly not going to play him if the rest are fit but use him as a squad player. Berbatov may love United, but so does Welbeck and so did O'Shea and Wes and others, Welbeck turned down a guaranteed starting slot at Sunderland and more wages, let the lad have a chance to stake his claim, he is the future and too good to be 4th choice striker. For those reasons I think Berbatov should move on, I believe in our young players and I think they will step up and prove doubters wrong. Also if they do not play enough, we could lose them. wayne -- I have to agree. It has become dreadful to see his name, and his comments never fail to disappoint. I'm convinced he sells insurance by day and religion by night. A one-track approach to drive his convoluted views home using every trick and twist that he can. When it suits him, he quotes the new testament, decrying the old. Then, in the next sentence he reverses the logic and says it proves something else. I have yet to see him partake in a decent and fair conversation. denton and 'arry by the time those 2 had finished you'd be leaving the showroom in just undies,no car,thinking it was a good deal. another surprise NBI Red Onion thinking berba should move on,really mate would never have guessed that one,recent form wellbeck over berba,considering berba picked up a knock and has barely played just wondering what you're basing that on?i think your drawing that conclusion from a couple of friendlies,what a laugh. PLEASE will someone show me the sir alex quote that he doesn't trust berba in big games? its like AA my name is NBI Red Onion and i'm a berba hater,after those horrible putrid things you wrote about berba we all know were you stand,so save it Stenis. Superb point. Good question. Think you are right. I loved Le Tissier but he was a lazy slob. Don't think he would last two minutes in todays game. Cantona would stil just be Cantona though. Can play in any era. Yes denton did apologise. Although did say can Tom cut it at Stoke on a cold Tuesday night. Course he can. He has played in shitload of games like that for Wigan and Watford. I can't stress enough just how good Tom is and can become. A talent we aint seen at United for a while aside from Scholesy. We sorely missed the likes of a Hargreaves or a Fletcher in MF, but the Champions league final also highlighted the dangers of not having the option available of changing the play up front. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise that Berba wasn't selected for that game -- if he had some people would now be laying the CL final result at his door too. It's a squad that's needed for the current campaign, as the more sucessful we get the more have to fight on all fronts. During the season some strikers will hit form, some will lose it (just like Rooney for much of last season), others will be injured or otherwise unavailable (as per Chico right now) and younger players will need to be bedded in. Not all opponents will pose the same problems. Competition for places is good in its own right and no player is undroppable. Unlike some on here I dont think SAF has ever been minded to build a team around a single player be that Rooney or anyone else, despite the machinations of the latter's agent last season. SAF never has done and never will. In short you don't dump your most skilful player and top scorer out of the squad on a dubious premise( a top scorer who doesnt suit our play , now there's novel concept ....!) Everything the berba bashers say is just nonsense,nothing fact based whatsoever,all of them stay on message and repeat the same things over and over again. Berba doesn't fit in.....top scorer......mom more times than anyone last year.....more game winners..fuck me if thats not fitting in give me 10 more berbas please. Sir Alex doesn't trust him,never seen that quote if sir alex didn't trust him wouldn't be wearing the shirt Just not utd class,hasn't quite made it,see point 1. Lazy doesn't run all over the place like a cunt......plays his position and give the team shape Misses to many chances,see point one and we'll forget rooney went god knows how many games without scoring but thats ok with the berba bashers because perfection only applys to analysis of berba no one else. repetition of lies repetition of lies stay on message just keep repeating the same shit that cannot be proven but hey why let the truth get in the way King Eric, you've been rating Tom highly for as long as I've been reading RoM, and a lot longer than I've been posting. It was actually you that alerted me to him in the first place, and you've never changed that tune. I say this to show that Tom is not a flash-in-the-pan, but the genuine article. Stateside- Rooney and Ronaldo WERE both almost undroppable, no two ways about it! Undroppable is probably OTT- but my point is, those were the guys (along with a few others) pretty much guaranteed their place in the side. You cannot tell me that we bought Berba with a view to him being a squad player. 'Its the same as if we sign Sneijder- another 27 year old on a big transfer fee and big wages. These guys are bought to be BIG players who play very regularly, and definitely in the big matches. In his first season, he played fairly regularly, including almost all the big matches. His second season, he still played a fair bit, but not week in week out as he would've been expected to, and he very rarely started the big matches. And last season- well, SAF showed his hand in the last few months, and in pre season. That's my opinion of course, I could be wrong......Berba may become a week in week out player....but considering his partnership with Rooney hasn't really lived up to expectations, I doubt it. Sparkz, but see, I just don't buy that argument. You say he was bought to play regularly, and you then go to make out like SAF has been using him less and less each year. In other words, you are trying to build an argument that he has been tried and he failed -- and this is evidenced by his usage, since SAF has been using him less and less. Trouble is, that's simply not borne out by history. The Berb's appearance stats have been remarkably consistent: 1st year, 31 PL, 43 total; 2nd year, 33 PL, 43 total; 3rd year, 32 PL, 42 total. I know you will come back and say something about "big matches", and I don't have those stats to hand. But his CL appearance stats are also pretty consistent, and I don't recall The Berb ever being used much in big matches. And before you or anyone else jumps in and says my last sentence proves a point, you know as well as I do that in recent years SAF has preferred a 451 for the bigger matches, and under that policy, there's only one striker going to get a look-in -- and that's Wayne Rooney. And in any event, as I have pointed out on many occasions in the past, in the PL, the significance of those "big matches" is largely a myth. Yes, as fans, they are the big days that we look forward to. But in terms of winning the league, the overwhelming evidence is that over the last 4-5 years, who wins the title isn't determined by who has the best record against the other top 4-5 teams. It's determined by who does best against the mid-lower teams throughout the season. The reason for that is simple: the mid-lower teams have become remarkably good, and very persistent at, developing and executing tactics designed to minimize the points lost against top teams. They have figured out that if they can restrict the points damage (and even the goal difference damage) against the leading teams, then they have a better chance of avoiding relegation. Last season, going into the second-last weekend, West ham were obviously fucked at the bottom. But there were 7 teams above them all with real danger of being relegated. Even at the end, positions 10-19 were separated by only 8 points. So those teams have become very effective at minimizing the damage against us and the other top teams, knowing that a point saved here and there may make all the difference. But for the leading teams, this is a big fucking problem, because it means that every match against those teams is a down-and-dirty fight for points. Nothing pretty about it. Nothing noble. And that's half the teams in the league. Half the matches a top team plays every season are against teams who are fighting for survival and desperate to save every point, even every goal of GD. Just ask the dippers, who found this out the hard way in the fat spanish waiter's last year: they trampled all over us and the other leading teams, but couldn't take points off the Stokes of this world, and thus lost the title -- to us. So when people deride the Berb because he doesn't play the "big games" and "only" plays the "crap teams" like the Stokes and Boltons and Wolves of this world, to me that's just ignorant about what it really takes to win this league. Good lord...United fans bickering all over...not good. Have a few beers or vodka lads....! Cheer up I dont know about Berba, I mean he is one classy bloke who has been nothing but professional and reverential towards United, but so were Wes and O'Shea and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. So if the boss wants him to go, he probably will. And judging by Sir Alex's actions lately, I think that is the case. SO lets leave it up to Sir Alex, and chill the fuck out guys. Although I will say this, even if you dont like one of our players, you can at least be respectful and classy in your criticsm like Denton. How can people be fighting after a performance by the young players like that...makes me wonder what would have happened if we had lost... Hi mate sorry I couldnt reply yesterday as I was leaving the office and then parental responsibility kicks in lol. Appreciate the comments and absolutely agree and likewise for yourself, that this is not a conflict merely just discussing our take on the situation. I think we have come round to the same way of thinking and it boils down to how you put it. Berba could easily show up in the next big game and become irreplacable as Park did. As I always stated I actually love Berba and me and my old man have fell out manay times over it. I generally beleieve he has the best first touch in football and gutted for him its not worked out as it should for a player of his ability. I have also read your comments for a long time buddy so dont worry about me taking it personally I am well balanced ebough to understand there will be objections and diagreement on opinions but thats what I love about football. King Eric is always advising on young talent coming through and I am also of the same view. I have been watching the kids for years at Moss lane as nothing gives me more joy than watching home grown progress through to the senior side. Cleverly is one player I have been banging on about for years and I must admit it come to the point when I didnt know if we was ever going to fit. A lad I met in the states when I was playing out there is a Watford season ticket holder and he says Tom is one of the best players he has seen at Vicarage road and they tried everything to buy him. So when King Eric bangs out about Tunnicliffe then BELIEVE as this kid is the real deal and I for one cant wait for him to mature over the next 18-24 months. I would just like to add something. For those who say our best performances were without Berbatov. I presume you did not watch CL final? Berbatov and Nani carried the team for half a season during which Rooney could not even control a pass let alone make one. If anything, it was the first half of the season that won us the title, helping us keep pace with a Chelsea side brushing aside everyone until their self destruction. If we were not breathing down their necks at that point, do you think they would have been pressured to do that badly? Ultimately, I say yes, although it is going to do football more justice to let Berbatov go, but we need him, even if it is not against the big teams in the big games. I am sure Sir Alex will tell you, every game counts, especially against the smaller teams. For those who say Berbatov can only perform against smaller teams, you have just utterly disrespected all the team below the top 6. Are games against them not worth the same 3 points? Just to add to Giggs12Gerrard0?s post at 8.36 on his Watford supporter's comment about Tom Cleverley. I grew up not too far from Watford and still have friends in the area and all the Watford fans I know say the same thing, that Cleverley's an absolute certainty to 'make it' at the top. Even more, I recently met the Watford Chairman who said the same thing, adding that Tom is a very level-headed, decent character, brought up the right way by his family and by United. He said you can really tell how United raise their kids, not just in football playing ways but in how to conduct yourself (Watford have had a couple of players on loan from United , including the young Jimmy Davis who tragically died in a car-crash). The Chairman (apologies, I can't remember his name) said that Fergie's brother had told him how highly Tom was regarded at Old Trafford and they expected good things from him. Berbatov is and always has been pure class. Both on and off the pitch for United. After his performances last season I see absolutely no reason why we should move him on or even entertain the thought of moving him on. Besides, I just had my 2011-2012 season Berbatov home jersey delivered today Absolutelty correct mate I think that is why we do loan so many players not because we are a better team but the way in which they are bred. It takes more than talent to progress hence the debate on young Ravel recently. More often that not most loans turn out in players making it or actually signing for the club. Chester and C Evans signed for hull, Ajose at Bury, Sunderland tried to but J. Evans, Clev at Watford, Wellbeck at Sunderland, the list is endless I dont know of any other team who has this ability to produce professional footballers. You have already described me as - blabbering - speaking a load of shit - making you angry - fucking kidding you - stupid - don't read between the lines - uneducated in common expressions - requiring little pictures to understand - limited All this because I consider Berbatov's uncommon skill to be currently unavailable in the market, and therefore wise to retain. Your opinions are stated as categorically, and defended as incontrovertible facts. My one brief opinion has been repeatedly slated by you, and you have attacked me continuously. I strongly request that you desist from this line. Stop now. Do not say another rude word to me. Your despicable behavior is worthy only of contempt. Be nice or shut it. Let's hope that Berbatov continues to score plenty of goals and win plenty of matches and points for us. Also, let's hope that his opportunities in high-profile games like Liverpool are frequent, deserved and rewarding. Come on Berbatov, show us more of that wonderful football, and score plenty! Come on United! nice article!!!!!!!!!! but there is 1 thing i wud like to share lets take 2010-2011 season... in 1st half before winter transfer window berbatov use to start and chicharito was on bench and he scored maximum of his 21 league goals in that half...but most of his goal were scored when rooney was on pitch.now for a statistics out of 21 goals scored by berbatov, 20 goals were scored when rooney was on pitch.in short rooney was the main man or the catalyst .rooney at that time was injured for couple of games and then his transfer saga and all..but when rooney didnt played berbatov couldn't score..that is not same for chicharito. he does not want rooney to help him score...that why sir alex opted for him in 2nd half of season chicharito started and berbatov was on bench... for me it does matter if berbatov stays or no coz rooney is our main player anyways if offer of around 15 million comes we should sell him...that would be good for him.... sir alex is intelligent as he knows he its no use to start berbatov as his best comes out when rooney is in form.....what if rooney gets injured (god forbid) then berbatov would be of no use..thts why this season he would keep macheda and welbeck even diouf to see how they play with rooney and sometimes without him...its good for future of united!!!!!!!!! yes he is useless in europe hasn't scored there in 2 years. yes he is replacable according to SAF who just replaced him with chicharito. yes he misses loads of chances. yes he is letargic and so on and so on someone compared him to riquelme above..been comparing those 2 in years..there's a reason why riquelme never did anything for a big team...i love to watch him but i wouldn+t want him in my club...he just isn't suited... Stateside- you make a good point, but I'm sure if you delve deeper into the stats of his last 2 seasons, you'll see that the closer we get to the end of the season- "squeaky bum time"- the less he seems to play. Rather than taking last season as a whole, where he made a lot of appearances, look at the most recent trend, which was the final 3 months. As I said, I may be wrong, but with Hernandez's partnership with Rooney, plus the emergence of Welbeck, I can't see Berba becoming a week in week out player. And sorry, but I refuse to believe that we paid 30m for a guy who Fergie never expected to use in the big games. Just not possible IMO, and if you remember in his first season, he played in almost all the big matches. Since then, he's been getting less game time in the crunch matches. The 4-5-1 argument doesn't wash either, coz we saw last season that he was playing with Rooney & Hernandez, so he's quite happy to play 2 up front in the big games. At no point will I ever criticise Berba for "only" scoring against the likes of Stoke. Coz as you rightly pointed out...every game in this league is tough. But it's more about the level of PRESSURE there is on a game. And you can't deny that games against the big 4, games in the Champions League, and any matches in the final 6 weeks of a season have a far higher level of pressure than anything else. And in all 3 of those categories, he generally hasn't produced. He was bought to be a BIG player, and big players produce when the heat is really on. Rooney played like an absolute drain for the first 2/3 of the season......but in pressure situations, when the stakes were at their highest, in the last couple months- he regularly came up with the goods. In any case, if Berba was to leave- I don't necessarily think we'd struggle against the smaller teams who park the bus and have a "unique" brand of football. We have MORE than enough firepower in our side to break them down. Rooney & Hernandez formed a great partnership because they're a combination for both types of opponents. If we play the smaller teams who'll defend deep...then Rooney has more space to operate in and work his magic. If we play against a team who pushes up, Hernandez will murder them. It's almost impossible for opposing teams to combat....the only way they can nullify them is if they control our midfield and simply stop Rooney and Chicha from getting the ball/midfield support, as Barca and Arsenal showed. You have been attacking me incessantly for days. All because I consider Berbatov's uncommon skill to be currently unavailable in the market, and therefore wise to retain. Despite my polite responses and regular requests that you desist you shout, and accuse me of - blabbering - speaking a load of shit - making you angry - fucking kidding you - being stupid - not reading between the lines - being uneducated in common expressions - requiring little pictures to understand - being limited - having issues - needing to man up - talking crap I think that this is based on the-day-before-yesterday's situation. I've noticed that the "smaller teams" are more willing to have-a-go and hope to catch lightning-in-a-bottle. Certainly, they know that they're unlikely to get much out of parking-the-bus not only at OT but also at AnFailed, The Emirates, Stamford Bridge, Wastelands, or even WhiteHartLane. The ultra-cautious approach is only evident at the very end of the season when a goal-difference might be crucial but in the majority of matches the "smaller teams" seem to have had a change in mentality and try to keep it close but also try to score against the run of play. This seems to me to be an evolution in the way the game is played. bero is a dream player at utd and don't forget bero is last year top goalscorer please sir alex fesguson don't sell him!!!!!!!!!!!!! my top team: 1 utd all da way 2 city 3 chelsea 4 spurs 5 arseal And young is brillant signing utd will win da glory 20 pemiership and da champion leauge this year yes berbatov stay berbatov last year top goalscores and my top 5 1 utd all da way 2 city 3 liverpool 4 chelsea 5 arseal And will utd ever buy sneijder and young played brilliant on sunday!!!!!!!!!!!! I agree we will win da premiership and da champion leauge Beautiful article. Glad and every bit relieved to see I am not the only one that sees Berba as a class act. The fact that a player would prefer to retire at United instead of being sold is pure loyalty. You don't get that much these days. Sentimentality or no, I support football and not business. I love Berba, his attitude, silky touches, loyalty, level-headedness and all. I'd love to see a retirement party for him at United. @ Wayne August 8, 2011 -- 18:57 Berba has been at utd for 6 years hmmmmm must have been asleep for 3 of those....Totally hilarious. I'm cracked up pretty!
NA nb	the sound a mind makes as it shifts... freaking. out. We're not really sure how to even talk about what is frightening us. There's no way to know whether this blog is a "safe" place to say anything about this topic, but because we're not sure, we have to err on the side of caution. That means that our fears don't get put into words, everything has to be ciphered and cryptic, but we absolutely must express our fear in some way, so we can't stay totally silent. We hate having to be so careful and so unclear, we long to let our worries tumble forth so they reside outside of us instead of dwelling in our hearts like darkness and suffering. But it is not our safety we have to be mindful of, our words here could impact another person's life. Perhaps there is nothing we can say about the circumstances at all without it being too much. What we can say, though, is that there is something we have been very worried about for weeks, and it is very serious but we have been able to contain the panic. However, tonight (it's 4am) we cannot sleep, and have finally begun to experience the uncontrolled sense of helplessness and terror that accompanies this scary situation. We are not in danger, or if we are, we certainly don't know about it. It's unlikely we are in danger, let's put it that way. It is not for our sake that we are beside ourselves with worry, crying, and panic. Ativan is taking the edge off, and smelling the calming scent of Vick's is making a small, but appreciated, difference to our emotional state. We are not big on praying, we don't even believe in "God", but we do find ourselves closing our eyes tightly and sending loud, repetitive, pleading thoughts into the universe: Please, please, please let things be other than they seem. thank you for these suggestions. to be honest expression of our feelings is secondary to the safety of a friend, but because we can't write about that, i suppose the feelings take center stage. i suppose it would be possible to journal about it or talk to a therapist or trusted confidante. no amount of expressing is going to equal the need we have to know this person is okay. thank you for your words, and we will do our best to be safe, you too. I'm sorry you're feeling so overwhelmed by fear. I wish we could know more about what is going on to try to help somehow. We really care about how you are doing. This doesn't sound like a good situation. Do you want to talk privately? I hope you will be okay. You have concerned me but I'm glad you said you're not in danger. Nel's idea is a good one. Perhaps try writing it in a journal nobody but you can read. Please take care of yourselves and let us know if you're doing any better or not. thank you so much for your concern. yes it sucks to be afraid and worried, but it's really not me (us) that i'm concerned about. i just desperately want my friend to be okay and am very worried that is not the case. Funny, we use Vicks too. We have the little inhaler thingies that you sniff, we always have one in our pocket or on the table next to us. It really does help. I'm so sorry things are so bad for yous, and for your friend. I'm pagan, and I'm asking my goddess to watch over you. If I, or any of us can help, please let us know. If yous need a friendly shoulder, we're here. -Nick iya nick, vicks is awesome, it just makes everything seem okay during that inhale. lol that makes me sound like a vicks junkie, i'm so not. i appreciate pagan well-wishes, ladygods are way more approachable in my opinion, though some of us have some bad memories around pagan stuff, obviously that is just because asshat people can turn anything, even really positive things like earth religions, into a tool. thanks for being here, ur support is much appreciated. i wish there was something any of us could do, but there isn't really. -jaime It's horrible to be stuck in limbo, with no way of getting news. Fingers crossed you hear something good soon. Nowt wrong with being a Vicks junkie lol I'm lost without my little Vicks inhaler! That and my e-cig, which currently tastes of fresh raspberries... yum! Sorry if my mentioning pagans upset anyone. You're right, asshats will twist anything, even peaceful and healing stuff. It makes me angry, coz like, hey, that's my shit being used to hurt, and that's so not cool. Stop it already! hugs and love (and licks if you're Jaime lol) -Nick e-cigs are really cool, i don't smoke but we have tried out our friend's e-cig and it was pretty fantastic. the flavored ones are so weird! hugs and love to you too (licks appreciated, though i'm sure anyone who sees this comment and isn't privy is going to have some weird thoughts about that, haha) Email us if ya wanna. We will listen. We arent sure if we know who your talking about, its just a guess. We could be totally wrong on it. But I hope you guys are ok. Sending good thoughts.

NA ne	During the second day of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, The Blaze took to Time Warner Cable Arena to speak with delegates about the most pressing issues of our time. Most of those interviewed were good sports, answering questions about the trajectory of the country under Obama, the Affordable Care Act and even Socialism. One of our conversations took an unexpected turn, however, when we asked New York delegate Julia Rodriguez about her views on the direction of the country. Rodriguez promptly shouted that she would, in fact, like to "kill" Mitt Romney. A spokesman for the Secret Service told The Daily Caller that the agency is aware of video showing a delegate at the Democratic National Convention expressing a desire to "kill" Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. He said the department is "taking the appropriate follow-up steps" with the woman. What in the world are people thinking to come out and blatantly threaten the lives of anyone, especially a candidate for the presidency? This is way over the line. It is one thing to disagree with people passionately, but quite another to issue threats like this woman has. We'll see just how the Secret Service handles things. I"m honestly not expecting much seeing as it's the DNC that this took place at. Why didn't the interviewer take advantage of the opportunity to question this women further? She could have gotten a whole lot of insite into the mindset of these fools. maryhowland did you get a look at her? lol she is a numnut. if that had been said about barry he woukld call in the fbi. cia. the national guard the black panthers and anyone else he could call. that person would be thrown to the tigers. this old fat idiot should be in the freaken prison maybe some one there will do something about it.
NA	Congratulations to Shirley of Launceston , the winner of the romantic getaway in the Tasmanian north east region.  Shirley will be enjoying two nights of luxury with her partner at Tin Dragon Trail Cottages in Branxholm. And with that announcement, you might think we'd be marking the end of articles we publish about north east Tasmania.  But no!  There's still lots of fabulous places we could share with you, and hope to explore more in the future. Shirley from Launceston will enjoy a romantic getaway at Tin Dragon Trail Cottages From our own experience, we know Shirley will have a fabulous time.  She could choose to stay on the lovely Branxholm property the whole time; maybe take the Chinese Heritage walk, pat the alpacas or picnic by the river.  If she's keen on Tasmanian wildlife , she could look for a possum or a platypus . Look for a platypus on the Branxholm Community River Walk, north east Tassie Hobbyts Dragon craft shop in Derby, in the Tasmanian north east region Fish Rock on the outskirts of the Tasmanian north east township of Derby To Mt Paris Dam; then a Beer at Weldborough Drive a little further afield, and Shirley could be standing at the base of the Mt Paris Dam , an engineering marvel. If she likes beer, she'd be certain to stop at the nearby Weldborough Hotel and have a chat with Mark and Felicity over a few micro-brews. Mt Paris Dam, a feat of engineering for the tin mining industry, north east Tasmania In fact, while driving around, there's lots of scenery and attractions to admire. We stopped briefly at the tiny township of Legerwood , to wonder at the memorial carvings on our way to Ralphs Falls and Pyengana Dairy . The rural scenery is simply breathtaking, with a magical vista in every direction. In the Blue Tiers, we inspected the site of the Anchor Tin Mine, and the relics of the historic stamper. But this is definitely one place that warrants more time to explore.  If you have a mountain or trail bike, or enjoy bush-walking and camping, the Blue Tier Forest Reserve would make the perfect holiday destination . The Forest EcoCentre in Scottsdale is a good place to collect information about the surrounding forests. Relics from the Anchor Tin Mine in the Tasmanian north east Blue Tier Forest Reserve We'd love to return to the Tasmanian north east region and forage for food.  Not out in the forest, but at places like Bridestowe Lavender and Yondover Goat Dairy. There's local markets and wineries and food producers offering gourmet travellers a unique experience in beautiful surrounds.  Of course, Shirley might prefer to have someone else cook her meals on a weekend escape , and there's any number of places to choose for a good feed. Hot and hearty: the food at the Weldborough Hotel was thoroughly enjoyable With Any Luck, We'll be Back As you can see, we've covered lots of ground already, but there's still lots more we could investigate in the future, given the opportunity.  We're excited for Shirley and very happy to have been involved with this giveaway for Tin Dragon Trail Cottages. Graham and Christine are definitely keen for people to appreciate what their region has to offer.  Judging by all the entries and feedback the competition received, many other people will be out exploring the Tasmanian north east as well as the winner.

John and I just returned from a delightful few days in the NE that included 3 lovely nights at Tin Dragon Trail Cottages. It's a sensational property and Graham and Christine are lovely hosts. As you've suggested, there's heaps to do both on the property and in the area. We're so glad we read your earlier article on Branxholm and Tin Dragon Trail Cottages and their competition which was what started us on this latest mini holiday. So... a big "THANK YOU" to Think Tasmania. On the property we really enjoyed our spa under the stars (or ... on the night when it was raining ... under the huge umbrella .... no stars seeing there were clouds anyway). The cottages here are really tastefully designed and built and everything is thought of ... from Glad Wrap to fresh flowers, generous breakfast provisions to availability of BBQ and picnic packs for pre-ordering. Wallabies and echidnas and alpacas are all here ... despite us spending some time sitting by the river, the platypus was shy, so we hope to meet him on a second visit. By the time we had visited the cheese factory and Pyengana , walked down to the base of Colomba falls (and back up), visited Branxholm (stunning vistas here over the rows of little lavender shrubs even though the lavender isn't in bloom till December) and Legerwood we had run out of time so.... we will just have to return for Mt Paris Dam , Ralphs Falls and Cashes Gorge, the Blue Tier and so much more .... lots more excuses for more NE holidays (not that any are needed). Wow Dorothy! We get lots of positive feedback, but this is way up there in terms of the best comment we've ever received. Thanks for taking the time to express your views so eloquently. We're extremely happy you enjoyed your holiday, as well as the website. Many, many thanks. You can write in any time!

So a big thanks to you. - Dianne We have been to Tassie many times BUT this is the best info we have had. Thank you. - Susan
ID	About 3.5kms from Tulum, on the road towards Tulum. There's heaps of cenotes along this road, but we stopped at this one on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel. We didn't come here as part of a tour - we had a hire car and were doing our own thing for the day. We visited a different cenote the previous week (Hubiku Cenote) which was so different I just can't begin to explain. Gran Cenote was just unbelievably beautiful - words just fail me. You park up at this nondescript location, walk down a set of wooden stairs into a wonderland. The water is so clear! Little turtles and brightly coloured fish swim around you, if you're not careful you bump your snorkel top into ancient stalactites, you can see the white sand at the bottom of the cave....well, the part of the cenote before it drops off into the underwater cave system. With the snorkels and masks we swam around and watched the divers go into the caves, and then return - their lights illuminated the deeper underwater areas beautifully. Almost made me want to learn to scuba! Entrance is 100 pesos per person, snorkel hire (including flippers and life vest if you want one) is 70 pesos for as long as you want. There was a cafe on site but it wasn't open when we visited. There was space to have a picnic if you wanted one. Toilets were fairly clean.

What a great visit!" Reviewed 7 November 2012 We took the ADO bus to Gran Cenote from Tulum-cost about 36 pesos for both of us--Very comfortable air-conditioned tour bus. You can get a round trip ticket-but we did not. We ended up taking a taxi back to Tulum and it cost about 100 pesos. Definitely should have gotten the round trip ticket. Arrived early afternoon. It costs 10 pesos each to get in. Bring your own breather thingy!--but they do have life jackets; breather thingys and masks for rent. I bought my mask and tube at the local grocery store for about $100 pesos- i believe. The water was wonderful; the views were awesome. The snorkling was great. It was not too crowded when we arrived, but it did get a little crowded later. Need to be careful about running into other snorklers. There were also scuba divers there as well. It was neat to be snorkling on top of the water and look at the scuba divers so far below with their lights. I was able to see alot of rock formations b/c I was tagging along with the divers who were using lights. It was very easy to get into the water-there were various entrances. The under water caverns were a sight to behold. I can imagine during the high season that this place would be packed and might not be so enjoyable. They have t-shirts for sale and a little cafeteria-we tried the food. I had some chicken flautas--not enough chicken in them and husband had a ham and cheese torta-he liked it--very cheap food.

Clear cold water and beautiful. Big rock arch to swim through. Walked the grounds and saw several other cenotes. Great photo ops here. For the snorkeler or the diver. This cenote is different from the others we have visited on other trips.

This machine is more capable at finding prostate cancer than any other type of scan - in both bones and soft tissue. Only currently available for public treatment from one place in the world. It is not likely to ever be found in your local neighbourhood clinic because it requires a cyclotron on site. It may, however, in future be found in larger centres in major hospitals. I am told that a hospital in Liverpool NSW is getting a cyclotron, but I do not know if that is true, or if they will be using it for this. Technical explanation - skip to the video link below if you aren't interested in the technology. (Jim Marshall is also not a physicist.) This cyclotron shoots beams of tiny particles at high speed. So did your old cathode-ray tube TV, at a much lower speed. The beams hit the screen and lit the dots up. So did your linear accelerator (if you had radiation), at much higher speeds than the TV. The beams hit the DNA in your cells and damaged it. Your cancer cells can't repair themselves as well as healthy cells. The cyclotron is much more powerful than either of these. It pokes tiny particles into atoms, where they stay temporarily, and then later fly out. In the process here, the cyclotron particle beam is aimed at Carbon, which then temporarily to turns into a radioactive form called Carbon 11 (C11). Radioactive C11 is attached to Choline, a naturally occurring substance from your body, and injected. Choline likes your prostate cancer cells better than other cells, and stays around the prostate cancer cells. The attached radioactive C11 sends out, or emits, small particles called positrons as it goes back to being non-radioactive carbon. A machine called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner can see these positrons flying out. The PET scanner makes a picture for your doctor - in this case with the active prostrate cancer cells brighter than others - as you can clearly see in the video in the link below. Because it can only see active prostate cancer cells it is of no use while hormone treatment or other drugs are holding you in remission - your PSA has to be rising. The cyclotron has to be on site because C11 loses its radioactivity very quickly - half the radioactivity is lost in 20 minutes. This scan looks like it could replace all others in searching for active prostate cancer where it can be made available.
IN NA dtp ne	tech-thoughts.net | Android | Apple | Sales & Market Share Analysis Labels Follow Us Sponsor 14 Aug 2012 Nexus 7 Sales Volume: Estimate Based on Supply Chain Data How many Nexus 7 units have Google & Asus sold so far and how many do they expect to sell this year? Those are the questions everyone wants an answer to and I'm going to attempt to do just that. Digitimes recently reported that suppliers will be shipping 4 million touch (OGS) panels for the Nexus 7 in Q3 2012. Based on this, and some other data we already have, we can make an educated estimate of the Nexus 7's sales volume. Q3 2011 Production & Sales Production Volume From the Digitimes report above, TPK Holding & Wintek are the suppliers for the Nexus 7's OGS panels. The two companies shipped one million units in June and 1.4 million units in July. Including the 1.4 million units in July, they have received orders for 4 million panels in Q3 2012. These figures should be equal to the number of Nexus 7 units going into production in each of those months/quarters. We also know that the initial shipment volume delivered to Google was 600,000 units in June . We also know that Google had initially estimated sales of 3 million units by the end of the year . This means that after looking at initial demand, Google & Asus may have roughly doubled their estimates and cranked up the production volume. Using these figures with Little's Law gives us a cycle time of 2.5 weeks, i.e. it takes 2.5 weeks to produce and deliver a Nexus 7 unit to Google. Since monthly production volume stays at roughly 1-1.5 million units, production capacity is unlikely to be a constraint. Therefore, we can assume a constant cycle time and calculate the total Nexus 7 orders delivered to Google at the end of each month. Sales Estimate Once we have the Nexus 7 units available with Google, all we need to do is calculate the initial "sell-through rate" to get an estimate Nexus 7 sales so far. The Nexus 7 went up for sale in mid-July and the 16GB units were sold out in a week and we heard initial reports of sell outs of the 8GB version in 3 weeks . Since we know the size of the first production batch was one million units, it is a reasonable estimate for sales volume at that time to be the same. Also, since we know that Google had ordered more 8GB units (as compared to 16GB units) the "sell-through rate" would be about 2-3 weeks. In order to normalize the sell-through rate for demand fluctuations throughout the year, we can assume a conservative sell-through rate of 4 weeks throughout the forecast period, i.e. any batch of Nexus 7 units delivered to Google take about 4 weeks to be sold (either online or to stores). Based on this, we can derive the following sales estimate for Q3 2012: Based on the 4 million units produced, we can estimate a sales volume of approximately 3 million units in Q3 2012. This was approximately the same as Google's original estimate for sales in H2 2012 (Jul-Dec). Q4 2012 Production & Sales Now, Q4 is where this gets a little more challenging. The original report from Digitimes states that monthly shipments of OGS panels are expected to drop to 0.1-0.4 million units because of increased competition from the iPad Mini and the new Kindle Fire. It is a little unclear if this is the shipment per supplier or the total number of shipments. In any case, such a production drop is extremely unlikely as there is tremendous market demand for high quality tablets at that price point. While the competition will have an impact on market share, rapid market expansion will ensure healthy Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ) shipment growth for major devices. In addition to this, Q4 is usually a period where demand surges because of holiday sales. In order to set a benchmark, let's take a look at the impact of the last two high profile tablet launches on the QoQ shipment volume growth of their competitors. As we can clearly see from the chart above, major tablet launches have had no adverse impact on the sales growth of competing tablets. Based on this data, 35-40% seems to be a reasonable estimate of QoQ shipment growth of the Nexus 7 in Q4 2012. However, the fact that we have two major tablet launches coming in Q4 (New Kindle Fire & iPad Mini) could cause a greater negative impact than seen previously. Therefore, it may be a better idea to consider a larger range of production volumes. Taking a 35% QoQ sales growth as a mean estimate, with the limiting condition that sales are unlikely to fall from Q3 to Q4, we get a sales estimate of about 3-5 million units in Q4 2012. This takes the total sales estimate in 2012 to 6-8 million units. These numbers would be a huge boost to Android tablets in their market share battle with the iPad and, in combination with the new Kindle Fire, would put them well on track to meet my mid-2013 market share expectation . Conclusion - Based on these data points, the estimate for the current sales volume of the Nexus 7 is over one million units. In total, we can expect about 3 million units to be sold in Q3 2012 and another 3-5 million units to be sold in Q4 2012. Recent Posts Subscribe 4 comments: I think you failed to take in account the distribution channel. Nexus 7 is actually available in US & UK, that , for comparable product those 2 countryies represent just 35 % of the WW market. If they were an HW company, they will release it everywhere as soon as supply constrain is over. In that case a 10 M is more likely. But may be the decision is linked to the Play store itself or with some agreement they have with Androids Tablet vendor and they will avoid entering new market.. You're right about that. I ignored it on purpose because we have no hard information on when distribution will be expanded. That's another reason why I thought it may be better to take a range for Q4's sales estimate. I think Google has reasons to expand distribution and reasons to hold back as well. You caught that part about their agreement with OEMs. Their goal was to show vendors how to compete with the iPad and they've done that. Now, OEMs need to emulate this strategy - Acer is the first to do this with the A110. September 3rd seems to be the almost official release date in France/Germany as well. So that might give a boost to September & hence, Q3 sales. Since my Q4 sales estimate is a range, I still expect it to be roughly around the higher end of that range.
OP rs	RELATED ARTICLES The Nature of the Church PETER KREEFT One thing we can do to help is to understand our Protestant ?separated brethren?. This task involves understanding how they understand us, or misunderstand us. The The umbrella issue that separates us, under which the other issues stand, is the nature and authority of the Church, for all the things that Catholics believe in that Protestants don?t (e.g., the seven sacraments, transubstantiation, praying to saints, Mary?s Immaculate Conception and Assumption, papal infallibility), Catholics believe in because of the teaching authority of the Church. What is the Church, as taught in Scripture, and what is the basis of our disagreement with Protestants over its nature? I was a Protestant (Dutch Reformed) for the first twenty-one years of my life. Becoming a Catholic was one of the two best things I ever did ? that, and marrying the greatest woman in the world. Yet, I have never lost my respect and affection for the faith of my Protestant friends. This part of the book is designed to help Catholics understand the most serious Protestant objections to Catholicism and to answer them. Such a task is necessary, not optional. We have entered upon a new age of ecumenism. Battle lines are being radically clarified and redrawn. It is finally becoming clear (almost everywhere except in Northern Ireland, it seems) to both ?sides? that we have misidentified our real enemies; that an orthodox Catholic and an orthodox Protestant have far more in common than either has with a Modernist in his own church. For the questions that divide Protestants from Catholics, like whether popes are infallible, are obviously less important than the questions that divide orthodox Christians from Modernists, like whether Christ really rose from the dead. If popes are not infallible, then our certainty about dogma may be in trouble, but ?if Christ is not risen from the dead, your faith is vain and you are still in your sins.? More misunderstanding and hostility have been overcome in the last thirty years than in the previous three hundred, in large part because of Vatican 11 and the last four popes, all of whom have placed dialogue with Protestants high on their agenda. In fact, John Paul II announced that one of the three priority items for his pontificate was reunion, first with Eastern Orthodoxy. (The other two were cleaning up the church in America and preventing nuclear war.) Healing the schism of 1054 with Eastern Orthodoxy involves overcoming far fewer obstacles than healing the division of the Protestant Reformation, of course. Yet we may not abandon even that harder hope, for it is clearly our Lord?s will that we be ?one flock, with one shepherd?. Our divisions are not necessary, not in the nature of things. They all began in history, and they can end in history. One thing we can do to help is to understand our Protestant ?separated brethren?. This task involves understanding how they understand us, or misunderstand us. That is our topic here. The umbrella issue that separates us, under which the other issues stand, is the nature and authority of the Church, for all the things that Catholics believe in that Protestants don?t (e.g., the seven sacraments, transubstantiation, praying to saints, Mary?s Immaculate Conception and Assumption, papal infallibility), Catholics believe in because of the teaching authority of the Church. What is the Church? As Pope John XXIII put it, she is our mater et magistra (mother and teacher), but she is our mother before she is our teacher. We are born into a spiritual family, not by physical birth but by faith and baptism. This spiritual family has various names. The three most important ones are (1) the Church, ek-klesia, literally the called-out ones, those who are called by God out of the world to be part of his new world, new kingdom; (2) the mystical body of Christ, Christ?s own hands and feet; (3) the people of God, the family of God. How do Protestants understand the Church? Because everything I have just said about the Church is clearly taught in Scripture and because orthodox Protestants believe everything in Scripture, they believe all these things. Where, then, is the disagreement? For one thing, it is a difference in emphasis. Protestants are more individualistic than Catholics. They tend to think that individuals are saved first and then join a sort of society of the saved. Catholics think, rather, that being saved is to be put into the Church, as Noah?s family was saved by being put into the ark. (The Fathers of the Church often used Noah?s ark as a symbol for the Church, by the way. When you compare the variety of creatures in both vessels, the comparison seems apt). But Protestants too have to admit that the Church is not just a human social club but of divine origin because Scripture clearly teaches this. Where, then, do they differ with us? Their criticism is usually that Catholics ignore the need to make an individual, personal decision for Christ, or choice to believe; that Catholics think they can be born into the faith, inheriting salvation from their parents. But this is not a doctrinal disagreement. It is a practical, pastoral concern. Most Protestants are willing to admit that individualism is a mistake, and most Catholics are willing to admit that being born into faith is a misunderstanding. Where, then, is the doctrinal, dogmatic disagreement about the Church? Perhaps it concerns the authority of the Church. Let?s assume that both Protestants and Catholics understand the true nature of authority: that it means right, not might, in fact, ?author?s rights?, and that in Christ it is wielded by love and service, not by lording it over others. Once Protestants understand this definition and understand that Catholics understand it too, the fear of the authority of the Church is largely dissipated. Because Protestants accept Scripture and because Scripture clearly teaches the authority of the Church (?He who hears you, hears me,? said Christ to his apostles), Protestants admit that the Church has authority. But some of them restrict this authority to the first generation of apostles, forgetting that these apostles themselves authorized successors, bishops. If you believe in the authority of Christ and Scripture, you must believe in the authority of the apostles because according to Scripture Christ authorized them; and if you believe in the authority of the apostles, you must believe in the authority of their successors because the apostles authorized them. Some Protestants will accept this succession in principle but say that the Catholic Church has betrayed its authority by misusing it (this argument confuses the person with the office) or that the Church claims too much authority (but how do they know what is too much?) or that the Catholic Church is not the only church with divinely commissioned authority. This last idea is quite unscripturall for Christ never spoke of ?churches?, only the ?Church?. He is not a polygamist. Protestants reply that these references to the one Church apply only to the ?Church invisible?, not to the ?Church visible?. But although the Church is invisible (mystical), it is also visible, and visibly one, in Scripture. Saint Paul was utterly scandalized at the beginnings of denominationalism in Corinth. Some Protestants think Catholics hold that the Catholic Church is divinely inspired, like Scripture, and has the authority to invent new dogmas. This is a misunderstanding. The Church does not claim divine inspiration to add to revelation, only providential protection to safeguard it from subtraction. Even the dogmas not explicitly found in Scripture, like papal infallibility and Mary?s Assumption, are not new but old. The Church merely defined the doctrines that had been believed and lived from the beginning. Papal infallibility certainly seems to be a specifically Catholic dogma that Protestants cannot accept. But they often misunderstand it. First, they often think of the pope as an autocrat rather than as the head of a body. (A head is part of a body, not floating above it in the air.) Second, they often think of the Church along political lines and want it to be a democracy. But Scripture thinks of the Church along organic lines, and no organic body is a democracy. Third, they often misunderstand infallibility as attaching to the Pope personally. In fact, it attaches to the office, not the person, and only when defining a doctrine of faith or morals. Perhaps in my haste I have overlooked something. But it seems that all the differences between Protestants and Catholics on this fundamental, divisive issue, the nature and authority of the Church, come down to (1) differences in emphasis, (2) practical, pastoral criticisms, (3) scripturally answerable arguments, or (4) misunderstandings. If this is so, then there is no obstacle in principle to reunion without compromise of dogma. This morning, while receiving the Eucharist, the thought struck me: ?How different we are from Protestants: they have no eucharistic Real Presence!? But then a second thought struck me: ?How like them we are even while receiving the Eucharist, for the whole point of the Eucharist is that very Christ whom they too love as their whole point and end and meaning. ? Our signs are richer, but the one signified is the same. He comes to us down different roads (e.g., the Mass), but the one who comes to fetch and fondle his sheep is one. And he wants to fetch them all home to be one.
IN	What Is Exponential? Introduction The usual explanation relates to a variable raised to the power of something. For example, 10 to the power of 2 is 100 (10 2 = 10 * 10 = 100). The 2 in this case in the exponent, hence the word exponential. Exponential functions of the nature F(x) = x n produce the classic exponential curve when plotted on a graph. "Most people have an intuitive understanding of what it means to have exponential growth . Basically, it means that things are increasing in an out-of-control way, like a virus in a horror movie." This is the sort of growth that, it is generally inferred, far surpasses any other kind of growth. Is it a necessary condition, however, that the growth rate must be constant? From the endnotes for Chapter 1 of "The Population Explosion" (Ehrlich, 1990): " Exponential growth occurs when the increase in population size in a given period is a constant percentage of the size at the beginning of the period. Thus a population growing at 2 percent annually or a bank account growing at 6 percent annually will be growing exponentially. " In this article I will be challenging the assumption that exponential growth requires a constant rate. Powers Of 2 Taking "powers of 2" as our example, here's what happens when 1 A-Pop keeps on doubling: From 1 to 1,073,741,824 - it's pretty explosive growth, isn't it? The problem with this view is that, from a real-world perspective, the growth occurs outside of time . How long did it take to get from 1 A-Pop to 1,024 C-Pops? Without factoring in time, such representations of exponential growth have no real-world value. The solution is simple - add a constant doubling period and it's easy to calculate. If the doubling period is 25 years, each row represents 250 years of growth. Hence, 3 rows worth of growth equals 750 years of growth. This is classical exponential growth. Given that it took 750 years in this case, would you call that explosive growth? The Rule Of 70 Using the Rule Of 70 , it is commonly accepted that a population that grows at 1% will double every 70 years (approx) whereas a population that grows at 2% will double every 35 years (approx). Giving each population 700 years to grow, it would look like this: Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 B-Pops 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 3 - Population Doubles Every 35 years for 700 years. It's exponential growth, but is this explosive growth? The following example is even slower. Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops, 1B-pop = 1024 A-pops Doubling Period 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 4 - Population Doubles Every 70 years for 700 years Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops, 1B-pop = 1024 A-pops Exponential Growth But Not Always Explosive Growth Clearly, the smaller the constant rate, the less "explosive" exponential growth becomes. Perhaps it's worth quoting Darwin at this point (Darwin, 1859, from the chapter The Struggle For Existence): "There is no exception to the rule that every organic being increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair." So, the point to remember about the popular perception of "explosive" out-of-control exponential growth is that all species of living creatures are capable of it. However, where the constant growth rate is kept close to zero, it should be no surprise that exponential growth can produce the illusion of almost stable growth. For example, a human population growing exponentially at 0.1%  would take approximately 700 years to double . Hardly explosive growth in human terms! However, even this humble growth rate is theoretically capable of producing a population that outweighs the Earth itself, in time. This is, in fact, a major argument against the "simple exponential" growth model (Kelly, 2002): "Truth be told, there are not a lot of natural cases in which exponential growth is exhibited. An exponential growth model assumes that there is an infinite amount of resources from which to draw." So Does Exponential Growth Require A Constant Rate Of Growth? However, the interest rate supposedly needs to remain constant for the growth to be classified as exponential. Really? Try these examples: Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 70 70 70 70 70 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Exponential growth for 175 years Exponential growth for 350 years Exponential growth? Table 5 - Population doubles at a constant rate of 2% for 175 years, and then  grows at a constant rate of 1% for the next 350 years. Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops So, if we describe the growth from 1 to 32 billion it can be said to be exponential. If we examine the growth from 64 to 1024 billion it can also be said to be exponential. What about the overall growth from 1 to 1,024 billion? What single word in the English language describes such growth? Why not exponential? If not exponential, then at which point was the growth no longer exponential? After all, both periods of growth are described in isolation as exponential. OK, then let's assume for the moment that we can define such growth - as seen in Table 5 - as exponential. However, such definitions lead to this... Table 7 - Population doubling alternates between 1% growth for 70 years and 2% growth for 35 years. Is this exponential? Certainly, each period of growth is, in itself, exponential. Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops Refer to US Census Bureau  - Incorrect Use of the Exponential Method for a discussion on actual variable rate compound interest at work (and the failure of the US Census Bureau to understand the growth model behind variable rate compound interest). Note the global population doubling between 1960 and 1999 from 3 billion to 6 billion - this was the result of population growth rates that varied between 1.2% and 2.09%. To illustrate the fact that variable rates of exponential growth are just as powerful as constant rates of exponential growth consider the following example for 3 starting populations of 1,000 each. One is growing at a constant rate of 1% per annum, one at a constant rate of 2% per annum, and one is growing at a 1% and 2% on alternate years. Graph A - Note that any  variation of the growth rate between 1% and 2% over time will always fall between the Constant 1% line and the Constant 2% line. Refer to The Scales Of 70 for a intuitive approximate explanation of how this sort of growth works in practice, and The Scales of e for an exact explanation using natural logarithms. Tightly Bounded Exponential Growth Or we could try closer and closer rates of growth, as shown in Table 8 and Table 9: Doubling Period 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 8 - 690 years of constant, exponential growth Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops and Doubling Period 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 9 - 710 years of constant, exponential growth Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops Now throw them together.... Doubling Period 69 71 69 71 69 71 69 71 69 71 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 10 - 700 years of inconstant, non-exponential growth. Hang on! Isn't this very close to Table 4 and constant exponential growth? Why is one exponential and the other not exponential? Isn't the result the same over the same period, tightly bounded by a narrow but variable rate of growth? Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops Here's another graphed example: Graph B - The closer the upper and lower constant rates get, the more tightly bounded the line for variable rate growth gets. Clearly, the more tightly bounded the variable growth is, the more and more obviously like exponential growth (at a constant rate) it gets. Nonetheless, the growth rate can vary how it likes between 1.1% and 1.2% and the line for variable growth rate will always fall between the two lines for constant rate growth. It is now absurd to argue that the term exponential growth must only be applied to populations that grow at a constant rate. Critics of the simple exponential growth model (growth at a constant rate of exponential growth) are quite right to dismiss it as having no real-life meaning. Logically, it cannot exist in nature as a universal law of nature because it is impossible for a population to keep growing forever without hitting a limit to growth . In fact, fixed rate compound interest (leading to constant exponential growth and constant doubling periods) is merely a special case of variable compound interest (leading to variable exponential growth and variable doubling periods). The fact is that no population can grow forever at any constant positive rate of growth. Hence, for real-world growth, simple exponential growth can only ever be used to describe growth for a limited period of time and never for all time. Simple exponential growth can only ever be a building brick. For humans for example, our annual growth rates are all simple exponential growth building bricks. However, variable exponential growth leads to a population growth model built from those bricks. Fixed rate compound interest resulting in constant doubling periods is described by the Malthusian Growth Model . This is also commonly known as exponential growth , or the simple exponential growth model. It copes with zero population growth, or a positive rate of growth, or a negative rate of growth. It does not cope with any combination of these 3 possible types of growth rate. Think of it as an illustrative theoretical model, rather than a real-life growth model. Variable rate compound interest resulting in variable doubling periods is described by the Couttsian Growth Model . It copes with zero population growth, and any number of positive rates of growth, and any number of negative rates of growth. It easily copes with any combination of these 3 possible types of growth rate. This sort of growth doesn't have an agreed, recognisable name, though to me it is fundamentally a form of exponential growth. Think of it as variable exponential growth , and not complex exponential growth. It's really not that complex! It's also fairly commonly used, for example in variable rate mortgage loans. It's really quite a familiar concept, though oddly it has never been recognised by the scientific community as a perfect replacement for the routinely dismissed Malthusian Growth Model. Variable exponential growth can easily match the out-of-control reputation of simple exponential growth, or produce an even better illusion of stable growth than we saw with simple exponential growth. This is because a population growing within a the Couttsian Growth Model is not compelled towards any limit to growth because the growth rate can vary , and is even allowed to go negative . The Couttsian Growth Model describes in simple mathematical terms a universal law of nature that applies to all populations of all species anywhere in the universe for all time. Annual Percentage Yield, Compound Interest and Exponential Growth ( Thanks to Paul Russo for inspiring me to write this section ) It is important to note the distinction between Annual Percentage Yield (APY) and exponential growth.  Here's an example of a starting amount of 400000 with 10% exponential growth for a year compared with calculating the APY using compounding monthly for a 10% annual growth rate: APY for 10% annual growth rate compounded monthly 10% Exponential Growth for a Year Monthly growth rate=&gt; 1.0083333333 1.0079741404 Period 0 400000.00 400000.00 1 403333.33 403189.66 2 406694.44 406404.75 3 410083.56 409645.48 4 413500.93 412912.05 5 416946.77 416204.66 6 420421.33 419523.54 7 423924.84 422868.88 8 427457.54 426240.89 9 431019.69 429639.80 10 434611.52 433065.81 11 438233.28 436519.14 12 441885.23 440000.00 For exponential growth, the growth for the year is effectively capped at 10% for the year, so the trick is finding a constant monthly exponential growth rate that will result in 10% for the year. This is the formula used: For APY even though an annual growth rate of 10% is the starting point, the aim is to increase annual growth beyond 10% by increasing the frequency of compounding period. The formula to calculate the monthly APY figure is: So in both cases the result is in fact exponential growth at a constant rate, and the distinction (in this case) is whether or not you are interested calculating a monthly growth rate that will cap exponential growth at 10% for the year or whether you are interested in exceeding 10% growth for the year by increasing the frequency of compounding periods to monthly. In both cases, fixed rate compound interest is the same as constant rate exponential growth. For any combination of Nominal Interest Rate and compounding periods, the limit to the exponential factor is represented by e to the power of that Nominal Interest Rate. For a more detailed treatment of  APY and continuous compounding, see my article Calculating APY and Continuous Compounding . Conclusion Sustained exponential growth at a constant rate is impossible. All supposed examples of such exponential growth in fact turn out to be temporarily sustained. There is no loan, and no investment, that could ever sustain a constant rate of growth. There is not one single documented example of any population of any species ever managing to sustain indefinite exponential growth at a constant rate. Take human populations. An annual population growth rate represents a temporary period (365 days, 52 weeks or 12 months) at a single averaged rate of growth. For example, if the target is an annual growth rate of 1% then the daily growth rate (ignoring leap years) is  1.01 1/365 for a limited period of 365 days. Surely 365 time periods at exactly the same growth rate constitutes "exponential growth"! Yet when we say 1% for 1 year people question whether this is exponential growth! Each year's population growth is, at best, described as temporary exponential growth. Hence, populations grow via consecutive periods of temporary exponential growth, with a different constant each period. This is a very messy and confusing way of describing how populations actually grow. Thankfully some demographers (Preston, Heaveline & Guillot, 2001, p.11) - although somewhat tentatively - appear to be ready to "raise questions" over the use of the term "exponential growth".  Describing the population growth rate as a continuously varying within the exponential function over time, and given that positive, negative and even zero growth rates all obey the same exponential function, the authors of one recent demographic tome argue (Preston, Heaveline & Guillot, 2001, p.11): " In this sense the term 'exponential growth' is a redundancy; all growth is exponential by our measure of growth as a proportionate rate of change in population size. When people use the term 'exponential growth' they are often (but not invariably) referring to a sequence produced by a constant positive growth rate within some interval. " The authors suggests reverting to Malthus' term "geometric growth" or perhaps "constant rate growth" for such growth. I note that this would therefore leave the term "exponential growth" available for variable rate exponential growth. For a different approach to explaining the same thing, read my articles the Scales of 70 and the Scales of e . If scientists insist that exponential growth requires a constant rate then they have nothing to use it for as no real-world examples exist. If scientists then resort to describing temporary periods of exponential growth (at a constant rate) then they are actually describing variable rate exponential growth. However, to spare them the embarrassment, just explain to them that what they are actually describing is variable rate compound interest .

Listen live here 2-4 pm EST, and call into the show at  (866) 348 7884  with your questions and comments. Hour 1: Dr. Brown's Bottom Line: Don't believe everything the media tells you about same-sex attraction.  There are plenty of people who have changed and all things are possible with God. No matter what troubles we have or encounter in this fallen world, due to the corrupt nature of fallen mankind, if in whatever state we find ourselves in, if we come to the good word of God and partake of it, and resist sin and the temptations thereof, no matter how long the battle against us may be, if we do not quit, if we do get up again, no matter how many times we may have fallen, if we resist, if we claim a promise of God, if we find a good thing to hold on to from the scriptures, no matter if it takes 10 days, 10 years, 50 years, no matter how many or how little, God is faithful to forgive, restore, renew, reinhabit, reclaim, and recondition us, and is it worth it? It's worth it as much as light exceeds darkness, as much as life is better than death or as much as joy is better than bitter sorrow, though sorrow in this world always comes first. Anybody willing? What if it took 50 years? How about 20? Would you be willing? What if it took only 10 days? Howabout being willing to go the right way forever? Christopher Doyle's article is succinct and right on the money. His conclusions are based on fact, and fair and correct interpretations of those facts. I believe this is true from both a therapeutic and political perspective. In fact, his article also compliments sound biblical principles. Thanks Christopher. Mainstream psychiatry and psychology has been thoroughly compromised by homosexual activists and sympathizing ideologues. "Homosexuality" was removed from the DSM list of disorders in 1973 as a result of to homosexual activist coercion, bullying, threats in 1973, and not based on any scientifically objective decisions. At the 1978 annual APA (American Psychiatric Association) meeting, a formal structure was adopted for the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Caucus of the American Psychiatric Association, which is now named the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists (AGLP). In 1978, an official APA Task Force on Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues was established, which was given formal status as a standing committee in 1981. The following year the Assembly, APA's legislative branch, approved adding elected representatives from a group initially designated as the Caucus of Homosexually Identified Psychiatrists, and later renamed the Caucus of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual psychiatrists. The Caucus is still active in the APA Assembly. Since its founding, AGLP with a membership of over 600 psychiatrists, has been active in helping to shape the dramatic conceptual shift in the cultural understanding and significance of homosexual behavior within psychiatry and within society. With the support of AGLP members, the APA has issued Position Statements supporting same sex unions and the adoption and co-parenting of children by same sex couples ( http://www.care2.com/causes/apa-unanimou\\... ), as well as a position statement opposing "Reparative Therapy" as unethical." ( http://www.citizenlink.com/2011/07/27/th\\... ) Nothing objectively scientific or neutral here folks. Any APA accredited therapist who specializes in issue of "gender" and "sexuality" are nothing but ideologues of the homosexual activist bias.
NA ne	Texting whilst walking... and other stupid ways to get fined In the UK, there are a few things that we can get fined for that might seem the tiniest bit petty: being five minutes late back to the car, dropping a piece of chewing gum on the floor or driving at 35mph might be some of the first to spring to mind. Spare a thought, then, for the residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, who can now be fined for... texting whilst walking. Yes, you read that correctly. In the past month, 117 people have been slapped with a fine for the heinous misdemeanour of 'reckless walking'. Apparently, the $85 fine has been imposed to stop pedestrians ignoring traffic signs and walking in the road. At least 20 people have been hit by cars in the town after being too engrossed in their phones to pay any attention to where they were going. If you want to text whilst walking along the pavement, though, that's ok. 10 more stupid ways to get fined Carrying a person or animal on top of your vehicle in South Africa Chewing gum in Singapore Driving an ambulance too fast in Australia Attempting to place a bug on your teacher in a bid to find out how to improve your grades in Stockholm Using the bus lane to drive your bus in Reading (this fine was put down to 'human error') Holding bible study sessions without a permit in California Having your foot run over by a police car and thus causing 'criminal damage' in Pontypridd, Wales Falling asleep under a hairdryer in Florida Smelling bad on a bus in Honolulu... if law makers in 2009 had had their way

GamersFirst: "Scotland would be a fine place to have a permanent office" Free to play MMO firm GamersFirst, the new owner of notorious MMO APB, is considering opening an office in the UK when the time comes to found a European HQ. When questioned by GamesIndustry.biz on the possibility of employing or contracting former Realtime Worlds staff members, CCO and CTO Bjorn Book-Larsson stated that "We are open to talking to everyone who was associated with the original game," though acknowledged that many staff had scattered to other firms. In the event that a number of ex-staff were contracted and the relaunched game proved successful, it was possible that a Scottish office could be opened. "Absolutely. Basically, the one thing we don't have at the moment is a European office, which is something we've been looking at. "We have looked at Hamburg in Germany, but what we're looking at now potentially is.... Well, Scotland would certainly be a fine place to have a permanent office. We'd consider that for sure." Government incentives - or the lack thereof - would not be a deciding factor in this decision, Book-Larsson suggested. "It would be more about being a strategic location for us than anything else. "Which is why Germany could also be a good one... I'm not sure that we're aware of what the various incentives are, so we haven't considered those." While GamersFirst has not revealed the sum paid for APB (to be relaunched in the first half of 2011 as APB: Reloaded), Book-Larsson did reveal that the game had other suitors. "There were several interested parties for sure. We happened to run into some of them too... So we know who they were. "It wasn't really a bidding war, I wouldn't say, but it was pretty clear that in order to be competitive you probably had to consider this as something you were going to invest quite a lot of effort into. And I think some people are probably more opportunistic in wanting to only pick up a piece or two."

Diamandis, who is currently putting the finishing touches to her second album 'Electra Heart', told Female First that she hadn't told anyone that she was writing songs until she was 20, as she was ashamed of her ambition. She said: "I think it was because I really wanted to be famous but was so embarrassed because it's not a nice trait to have." She then added: I couldn't admit it to anyone because they would be like, 'How are you going to make this happen? What talent do you have?'. And I wasn't any good at music yet. So I thought I would wait until I could show them I was famous, instead of telling them.

PIMCO's Bill Gross: 'The Age of Inflation Is Upon Us' Credit lenders are frugal, will not indulge 'obese' borrowers In typical Bill Gross style, the head of the world's largest bond shop employs the Lindy dance craze, former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince, the Wimpy cartoon character and his dying cult of equity argument in a mash-up of prose to describe the "age of inflation that is upon us," which he claims typically "provides a headwind, not a tailwind, to securities prices in both stocks and bonds." In his monthly outlook for September he begins, as usual, with a bit of history. "Credit, of course, is what makes the global economy go ...Wimpy said it best, 'I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,'" Gross writes. "So McDonald's grew from a million to 500 billion served and Wimpy and his wimpalikes were delighted in the exchange, although their arteries and midsections inevitably came out a loser ... But in order to promote and indeed foster continuing symbiosis, both borrower and lender need to operate in a nutrient-rich environment, a "credit" petri dish of sorts which fosters strong bones and healthy lenders and borrowers in their adult years. That unfortunately does not seem to be the case. Wimpy's weight-challenged midsection, he continues, is an "obvious testament to the overleveraged condition of today's global borrowers. Too much debt leads to forced diets and de-levering, a process which has been ongoing since Lehman 2008. Borrowers are just not in a healthy place and if history is our guide, their restoration may be almost biblical in terms of timing: seven years of fat followed by seven years of lean -- perhaps even longer." Gross adds lenders will not easily lend money to an obese over-indebted borrower, but will also not extend a check when the yield, carry and return on investment is so low that it cannot compensate for historic business model overheads. When yields are too low, and acceptable risk spreads so narrow that top-line interest revenue is increasingly marginalized, then lending is at risk. "Last month's 'dying cult of equity' Investment Outlook elicited a lot of excitement, but somehow failed to impress readers with its main point: Returns from both stocks and bonds will be stunted. How could one argue otherwise on the bond side with investment grade bonds yielding only 1.75%? How could one argue otherwise for stocks under the assumption that bond and stock returns were at least in part mathematically conjoined at the hip? How could one argue otherwise when it is obvious that boomers and Xers, Ys and Zers are likely to be disenchanted for their own good reasons for years?" If he were an individual investor, Gross adds, he would do this: "Balance your asset mix according to your age. Own more stocks if you are young, but more bonds if you are in your 60s, like myself. If you choose an investment advisor, a mutual fund, or an ETF, make sure that your fees are minimized. After all, if overall returns average 3% to 4% annually, how can you possibly afford to give 100 basis points of it back? You cannot. And be careful. The age of credit expansion which led to double-digit portfolio returns is over. The age of inflation is upon us, which typically provides a headwind, not a tailwind, to securities price -- both stocks and bonds."

HI	Navigation Mezzanine primarily revolves around the models found in two packages, mezzanine.core and mezzanine.pages . This section describes these models and how to extend them to create your own custom content for a Mezzanine site. The foundation of a Mezzanine site is the model mezzanine.pages.models.Page . Each Page instance is stored in a hierarchical tree to form the site's navigation, and an interface for managing the structure of the navigation tree is provided in the admin via mezzanine.pages.admin.PageAdmin . All types of content inherit from the Page model and Mezzanine provides a default content type via the mezzanine.pages.models.RichTextPage model which simply contains a WYSIWYG editable field for managing HTML content. In order to handle different types of pages that require more structured content than provided by the RichTextPage model, you can simply create your own models that inherit from Page . For example if we wanted to have pages that were authors with books: from django.db import models from mezzanine.pages.models import Page # The members of Page will be inherited by the Author model, such # as title, slug, etc. For authors we can use the title field to # store the author's name. For our model definition, we just add # any extra fields that aren't part of the Page model, in this # case, date of birth. class Author ( Page ): dob = models . DateField ( "Date of birth" ) class Book ( models . Model ): author = models . ForeignKey ( "Author" ) cover = models . ImageField ( upload_to = "authors" ) Next you'll need to register your model with Django's admin to make it available as a content type. If your content type only exposes some new fields that you'd like to make editable in the admin, you can simply register your model using the mezzanine.pages.admin.PageAdmin class: Any regular model fields on your content type will be available when adding or changing an instance of it in the admin. This is similar to Django's behaviour when registering models in the admin without using an admin class, or when using an admin class without fieldsets defined. In these cases all the fields on the model are available in the admin. If however you need to customize your admin class, you can inherit from PageAdmin and implement your own admin class. The only difference is that you'll need to take a copy of PageAdmin.fieldsets and modify it if you want to implement your own fieldsets, otherwise you'll lose the fields that the Page model implements: When registering content type models with PageAdmin or subclasses of it, the admin class won't be listed in the admin index page, instead being made available as a type of Page when creating new pages from the navigation tree. Note When creating custom content types, you must inherit directly from the Page model. Further levels of subclassing are currently not supported. Therefore you cannot subclass the RichTextPage or any other custom content types you create yourself. Should you need to implement a WYSIWYG editable field in the way the RichTextPage model does, you can simply subclass both Page and RichText , the latter being imported from mezzanine.core.models . When creating models that inherit from the Page model, multi-table inheritance is used under the hood. This means that when dealing with the page object, an attribute is created from the subclass model's name. So given a Page instance using the previous example, accessing the Author instance would be as follows: The view function mezzanine.pages.views.page handles returning a Page instance to a template. By default the template pages/page.html is used, but if a custom template exists it will be used instead. The check for a custom template will first check for a template with the same name as the Page instance's slug, and if not then a template with a name derived from the subclass model's name is checked for. So given the above example the templates pages/dr-seuss.html and pages/author.html would be checked for respectively. The view function futher looks through the parent hierarchy of the Page . If a Page instance with slug authors/dr-suess is a child of the Page with slug authors , the templates pages/authors/dr-seuss.html , pages/authors/dr-seuss/author.html , pages/authors/author.html , pages/author.html , and pages/pages.html would be checked for respectively. This lets you specify a template for all children of a Page and a different template for the Page itself. For example, if an additional author were added as a child page of authors/dr-suess with the slug authors/dr-seuss/theo-lesieg , the template pages/authors/dr-seuss/author.html would be among those checked. A typical problem that reusable Django apps face, is being able to extend the app's templates rather than overriding them. The app will usually provide templates that the app will look for by name, which allows the developer to create their own versions of the templates in their project's templates directory. However if the template is sufficiently complex, with a good range of extendable template blocks, they need to duplicate all of the features of the template within their own version. This may cause the project's version of the templates to become incompatible as new versions of the upstream app become available. Ideally we would be able to use Django's extends tag to extend the app's template instead, and only override the template blocks we're interested in. The problem with this however, is that the app will attempt to load the template with a specific name, so we can't override and extend a template at the same time, as circular inheritance will occur, eg Django thinks the template is trying to extend itself, which is impossible. To solve this problem, Mezzanine provides the overextends template tag, which allows you to extend a template with the same name. The overextends tag works the same way as Django's extends tag, (in fact it subclasses it), so it must be the first tag in the template. What it does differently is that the template using it will be excluded from loading when Django searches for the template to extend from. So far we've covered how to create and display custom types of pages, but what if we want to extend them further with more advanced features? For example adding a form to the page and handling when a user submits the form. This type of logic would typically go into a view function, but since every Page instance is handled via the view function mezzanine.pages.views.page we can't create our own views for pages. Mezzanine solves this problem using Page Processors . Page Processors are simply functions that can be associated to any custom Page models and are then called inside the mezzanine.pages.views.page view when viewing the associated Page instance. A Page Processor will always be passed two arguments - the request and the Page instance, and can either return a dictionary that will be added to the template context, or it can return any of Django's HttpResponse classes which will override the mezzanine.pages.views.page view entirely. To associate a Page Processor to a custom Page model you must create the function for it in a module called page_processors.py inside one of your INSTALLED_APPS and decorate it using the decorator mezzanine.pages.page_processors.processo\\... . Continuing on from our author example, suppose we want to add an enquiry form to each author page. Our page_processors.py module in the author app would be as follows: The navigation tree in the admin where pages are managed will take into account any permissions defined using Django's permission system . For example if a logged in user doesn't have permission to add new instances of the Author model from our previous example, it won't be listed in the types of pages that user can add when viewing the navigation tree in the admin. In conjunction with Django's permission system, the Page model also implements the methods can_add , can_change and can_delete . These methods provide a way for custom page types to implement their own permissions by being overridden on subclasses of the Page model. Each of these methods takes a single argument which is the current request object. This provides the ability to define custom permission methods with access to the current user as well. Note The can_add permission in the context of an existing page has a different meaning than in the context of an overall model as is the case with Django's permission system. In the case of a page instance, can_add refers to the ability to add child pages. For example, if our Author content type should only contain one child page at most, and only be deletable when added as a child page (unless you're a superuser), the following permission methods could be implemented: We've looked closely at the aspects of individual pages, now let's look at displaying all of the pages as a heirarchical menu. A typical site may contain several different page menus, for example a menu that shows primary pages on the header of the site, with secondary pages as drop-down lists. Another type of menu would be a full or partial tree in a side-bar on the site. The footer may display a menu with primary and secondary pages grouped together as vertical lists. Mezzanine provides the page_menu template tag for rendering the above types of page menus, or any other type you can think of. The page_menu template tag is responsible for rendering a single branch of the page tree at a time, and accepts two optional arguments (you'll usually need to supply at least one of them) in either order. The arguments are the name of a menu template to use for a single branch within the page tree, and the parent menu item for the branch that will be rendered. The page menu template will be provided with a variable page_branch , which contains a list of pages for the current branch. We can then call the page_menu template tag for each page in the branch, using the page as the parent argument to render its children. When calling the page_menu template tag from within a menu template, we don't need to supply the template name again, as it can be inferred. Note that by omitting the parent page argument for the page_menu template tag, the first branch rendered will be all of the primary pages, that is, all of the pages without a parent. Here's a simple menu example using two template files, that renders the entire page tree using unordered list HTML tags: The first file starts off the menu without specifying a parent page so that primary pages are first rendered, and only passes in the menu template to use. The second file is the actual menu template that includes itself recursively for each branch in the menu. We could even specify a different menu template in the call to page_menu in our menu template, if we wanted to use a different layout for child pages. Each Page instance has a field in_menus which specifies which menus the page should appear in. In the admin interface, the in_menus field is a list of checkboxes for each of the menu templates. The menu choices for the in_menus field are defined by the PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES setting, which is a sequence of menu templates. Each item in the sequence is a three item sequence, containing a unique ID for the template, a label for the template, and the template path. For example in your settings.py module: The selections made for the in_menus field on each page don't actually filter a page from being included in the page_branch variable that contains the list of pages for the current branch. Instead it's used to set the value of page.in_menu for each page in the menu template, so it's up to your menu template to check the page's in_menu attribute explicitly, in order to exclude it: Note that if a menu template is not defined in the PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES setting, the branch pages supplied to it will always have the in_menu attribute set to True , so the only way this will be False is if the menu template has been added to PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES , and then not selected for a page in the admin interface. Sometimes you might need to use regular Django applications within your site, that fall outside of Mezzanine's page structure. Mezzanine fully supports using regular Django applications. All you need to do is add the app's urlpatterns to your project's urls.py module. Mezzanine's blog application for example, does not use Page content types, and is just a regular Django app. Mezzanine provides some helpers for your Django apps to integrate more closely with Mezzanine. The abstract model mezzanine.core.models.Displayable and associated manager mezzanine.core.managers.PublishedManager provide common features for items that can be displayed on the site with their own URLs (also known as slugs). Mezzanine's Page model subclasses it. Some of its features are: Models that do not inherit from the Page model described earlier should subclass the Displayable model if any of the above features are required. An example of this can be found in the mezzanine.blog application, where BlogPost instances contain their own URLs and views that fall outside of the regular URL/view structure of the Page model. A common requirement when using regular Django apps with Mezzanine is for pages in the site's navigation to point to the urlpatterns for the app. Implementing this simply requires creating a page with a URL used by the application. The template rendered by the application's view will have a page variable in its context, that contains the current page object that was created with the same URL.

Sundries AOC Book Club: Jimmy: My Story In James Anderson's autobiography, Jimmy: My Story , England's attack leader makes some startling revelations about the truth of that disastrous tour Down Under in 2006/07. In the following extract, he reveals the boozy culture that developed amongst the players that ultimately led to Andrew Flintoff's infamous 'Fredalo' incident at the World Cup in the Caribbean. A Sobering Winter There is one night of shame that will be indelibly linked with the winter of 2006/07. It has been referred to ever since simply as the pedalo night. The night that ended with Andrew Flintoff knee-deep in the Caribbean Sea at around 2am, and he and a number of other members of our World Cup squad, including yours truly, in altogether hotter water. However, this excessive night on the beer wasn't spontaneous and isolated. It had been, excuse the expression, brewing for months. There weren't many England tourists that winter who could paint a saintly picture of themselves when it came to the consumption of alcohol in Australia. When you consider that we were an international sports team, it is shocking to consider what went on during that Ashes trip. Undoubtedly, some of our guys turned to booze as a direct consequence of what was happening to us on the field against one of the best international teams in history. Things hit new lows for a lot of our Ashes squad that winter, we weren't enjoying the tour either individually or collectively, and we were being comprehensively outplayed by a side intent on putting their name in international cricket folklore. We were getting abused by crowds to an Olympic standard -- in volume at least, both noise and amount, if not content: 'What do you call an Englishman with a hundred next to his name? A bowler' is a slow burner I grant you and one day soon it might raise a laugh. While their punters got zero marks for originality, however, we got a similar score for our efforts. Goodness knows what level of stick we were getting back home -- thankfully we have an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach to British headlines and news bulletins when on the other side of the world. But we got the gist of disappointment resonating around the country because we felt it ourselves as we lurched from defeat to defeat. And we sought solace in the bottom of pint glasses. Our first beer was usually in what the Australians call their rooms -- never been sure why they use the plural as they only ever showed us one, and it was the one they got changed in -- after matches. Having a drink post-match with the opposition became a feature of the 2005 Ashes and so we upheld the Australian practice of displaying grace in defeat throughout the series, although being there among them became increasingly annoying with each pasting. To be fair, the Australians displayed great levels of humility throughout that Test series, except that is for Michael Clarke , in the aftermath of Adelaide, where we prised defeat from the gums of a well-chewed draw. While others chatted with opposite numbers about the game, Clarke was being a complete pain, whistling away to himself and carrying on in a most arrogant manner. He and I are very much contemporaries. Having first met on a night out in Blackburn in the late 1990s when he was an overseas player in the Lancashire League, we then made our international debuts within the space of a month during the VB Triangular Series in 2002/03. And his aloof behaviour on this occasion seriously pissed me off. I said as much to Damien Martyn, who I was sat chatting to at the time, and, looking down at my feet, added: 'See this pad here, I really want to wrap it around his head.' 'Do it,' Martyn replied, completely straight-faced. Now while Martyn was notorious for being someone who did not mix particularly well with his own teammates, and was not close to anyone, preferring to be something of a lone wolf, his bullish attitude nevertheless took me aback. I looked at him again as if to ask: 'Are you sure?' 'Do it!' he repeated. As I'd had a couple of beers, I didn't need a second invitation, so I picked this pad up and cuffed Clarke with it, making the biggest thud imaginable in the process, and causing everyone in the room to stop nattering. For a split second there was complete silence. 'What the f**k ya doing?' he snarled. Naturally, the temperature in the room had risen and the sensible thing to do was to cool it by cutting the night short and leaving. For once that winter, we did the sensible thing. It was not an episode I look back on with any pride but the theme of drowning our sorrows and seeking solace in beer was extended throughout the rest of the trip. It is fair to say that I was lacking direction both on and off the field at times. Although I considered that scene with Clarke to be something and nothing, there was one incident during the one-day triangular tournament that followed which makes me cringe with embarrassment and regret. It came on the eve of the series when, typical of the drinking culture that had developed, a few of us really went for it one night. Not any night, mind: a night 36 hours before a one-day international. Now we all make mistakes, and I've made my share during a 10-year international career, but this escapade in Melbourne broke all the rules. In a disciplined team you do not need curfews and clock-ins because common sense prevails and players self-police -- but on this tour we lacked maturity. "One thing led to another": defeats and drinks started to snowball on the 2006/07 tour There were no thoughts of anything heavy when Andrew Flintoff, Ed Joyce, Chris Read and I headed out from our Hyatt hotel base for the evening. We were just popping out for dinner and a glass of wine. But one thing led to another, a late night developed into an early morning and we ended up staggering back at 6am. We hadn't ventured very far -- both the pub and the karaoke bar we frequented were within spitting distance -- but the fact that I would even consider boozing in the early hours, other than after a landmark Test victory or series-sealing one-day win, during an international tour obviously doesn't reflect well on me. We displayed complete disdain for the trust that had been placed in us, and such was our lack of self-respect that we sneaked into fast-food joint Hungry Jack's -- Australia's Burger King -- for breakfast before nabbing an hour's sleep. Hardly an ideal diet for an international sportsman, let alone one that was required on the bus for practice at nine o'clock that morning. Stuff like that shows how bad things had got on that tour. It had worn us down to such an extent that all sense of professionalism had been eradicated. Nights out, guzzling, were our form of escapism, our release from reality. Fred was pulled up by Duncan Fletcher after turning up for training in Perth smelling of alcohol, following a typically one-sided defeat against Australia on Australia Day a couple of days earlier. He was fined for his dishevelled state and threatened with removal of the captaincy. But he was one individual among many on a tour that turned into something of a booze cruise. The presence of New Zealand, probably the most sociable team in world cricket, as the third country in that VB Triangular Series hardly helped. Because there were always a few days between games, it meant you could generally hit it hard immediately after a match -- the Kiwis were nearly always in town and hail from a nation that doesn't need asking twice when it comes to a night out -- with the guarantee of a recovery kip the following afternoon. The management were certainly not aware of our state of inebriation in the build-up to the MCG opener, and I must confess I managed to wing it very well at practice that day. I am sure others did too on other occasions. The universal attitude seemed to be that as we couldn't do any worse preparing properly, we should try to have a bit of fun along the way, and see where that got us. There was a real mood of c'est la vie around the camp, and whenever you've got social animals like Fred in tow, and aren't discouraging them from drinking, things are bound to get messy. So the seeds of excess were sown thousands of miles away, down the road from St Kilda, rather than in St Lucia, the place in which our shoddy behaviour was well and truly exposed. These things tend to snowball if you don't nip them in the bud immediately, and to add to the routine of getting blitzed immediately after one-day internationals, one or two crept out for a few quiet ones rather too often. Evidently, I was one of those transgressors. It was indicative of my state of mind at the time, and is behaviour I would not contemplate these days a week before a match let alone a few hours. At the time I was in my mid-twenties, one of a number of young players in the squad, and confidence was fragile as we switched from red- to white-ball cricket.
OP ob	10 Unrealised Films We Wish Had Been Completed! (As our editor Matt Holmes turns 25 today, he's out of office and we are going to re-publish some old favourites.) With the frustrating news breaking last week that Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (based on an H.P. Lovecraft story) is 'dead', I began thinking about some of the other potentially great projects that audiences were tragically destined to never see. From further research it's clear that the major directors that have worked within the industry have abandoned vast numbers of productions that would have easily been big money makers and both critical and financial successes. Indeed, filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Orson Welles have abandoned dozens of projects, even after beginning production on some of them! Read on to discover the ten unrealised features that we'd love to have seen completed... 10. GEORGE SLUIZER'S DARK BLOOD George Sluizer's Dark Blood starred River Phoenix as Boy, a widower who lives as a hermit on a nuclear testing site. In this tale of a dystopian future, Boy waits for the end of the world while making dolls he believes have magical powers. Boy ends up helping a couple (Jonathan Pryce and Judy Davis) when their car breaks down whilst travelling through the desert. Only 11 days short of completion, the production was shut down by the tragic death of Phoenix outside the Viper Room in LA from a drug overdose. Angry at the loss of expenses through the abandonment of the production, Phoenix's grieving mother was sued by the films producers for $6 million to compensate for this, claiming that the actor had not declared his drug use! Needless to say, the case eventually collapsed. What finished portions of the film remain in existence are still entirely owned by director George Sluizer. Whilst he will never complete the film for general release now that Phoenix is gone, he has suggested that he intends to use it as footage in a documentary about the actor's life. Some really raw footage on YouTube remains the only scenes released to the public to this day... 09. JERRY LEWIS' THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED Jerry Lewis , known predominantly for his comedy films and cabaret acts with partner Dean Martin, was also fond of directing. Behind the camera of some of his most successful work (including The Bellboy [1960] and The Nutty Professor [1963]) his unique gift for comedy proved an excellent skill when it came to directing. However, how he thought he could turn a film about a clown hired to entertain children as they are sent into a darkly humorous comment on society is beyond me. Whilst it was intended to be a piece of comic pathos on one of humanity's darkest hours, it simply screamed of bad taste. Lewis began production believing that he was creating something worthwhile on the horrors of the Holocaust, however it soon became apparent that his changes to the script (in an attempt to make the clown character he played more sympathetic) meant the film left a bitter taste in any viewer's mouth. As well as narrative set backs, production was hindered by a lack of money supplied by producer Nathan Waschberger (who eventually ran out of money before production completed), the damage and late delivery of equipment and the major problem that Waschberger's option for the screenplay had expired before shooting began (he apparently paid an initial $5000 fee to authors Joan O'Brien and Charles Denton, but failed to send a further $50000 that was due before production began). Filming was all but complete when production was shut down due to the lack of financing and it is reported that Lewis owns the only videotaped copy of the film in existence (the whereabouts of the original negative is unknown). In his autobiography Jerry Lewis in Person, the director claims that he will release a version of the film for public viewing if he can return to Sweden for some final pick-up shots. However, the likelihood of this happening is very slight and Lewis refuses to comment on the film in any interviews. Whether or not this is a bad thing remains debatable! If, however, you have a pressing urge to view the film it seems the only way of doing so is by getting yourself invited to one of the exclusive screenings put on by long time Hollywood insiders. However, if it's highly unlikely that you'll find yourself invited to such an event I'm afraid you'll have to class this as one of those films that you simply weren't meant to see... 08. ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S THE SHORT NIGHT After a rather insipid citical and viewer response to Family Plot (1976), Alfred Hitchcock intended to return to his comfort zone for what he intended to be his last film. This project was based on the novel The Short Night , a spy thriller by Ronald Kirkbride . A British double agent manages to escape from prison and flees to Moscow, where his wife and children are await him. An American agent plots to intercept him but falls in love with the double agent's wife in the process. The Short Night was to be the director's third attempt to produce a more realistic James Bond film. His previous two attempts, Torn Curtain (1966) and Topaz (1969) had had a limited critical and box office success and The Short Night was envisioned as Hitch's return to form. Clint Eastwood, Walter Matthau and Sean Connery were all courted as possible male leads, the latter said to be the favourite. Liv Ullman was asked to play the double agent's wife. Sean Connery in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964) Problems began early in the pre-production stage, when James Costigan , the first writer employed to pen the adaptation, had a number of disagreements with the director. Hitchcock eventually asked for Costigan to be 'paid off' and removed from the project! Previous collaborator Ernest Lehman then agreed to tackle the script, but his feeling that the story would be better focusing on the American spy did not tally with Hitch's own ideas. The final blow to the Lehman-Hitchcock relationship came when the writer decided to remove the double agent's escape from prison out of the adaptation. After an argument with the director Lehman left the project and Norman Lloyd (an old friend of Hitch's) took on the job. In a hurry to get the ball rolling, Hitchcock suggested that Lloyd start work on the screenplay straight away, but the writer refused, stating that they were unprepared. Hitchcock, angry at Lloyd's objections, fired the writer and decided to work on the screenplay himself. Throughout the epic pre-production saga both Universal and the various writers involved were worried by Hitch's failing health. Eventually, the director was forced to abandon the project, as his health continued to decline. What was intended, as a grand farewell to his followers, never came into fruition and the world was unfortunately left with the rather uncharacteristic Family Plot as the final work of one of the cinema's greatest directors. 07. DAVID LYNCH'S RONNIE ROCKET Based on a script director David Lynch had penned over a whole decade, Ronnie Rocket was a project close to its creator's heart. Intending to combine many typical Lynchian thematic obsessions -- including an idealised image of 1950s culture, an industrial design aesthetic, midgets and physical deformity -- Ronnie Rocket was the film he originally intended to make after Eraserhead (1976). After viewing Eraserhead, executive producer Stuart Cornfield approached Lynch with an offer to help with his next project. Lynch suggested Ronnie Rocket, but soon realised that nobody would option it and thus shelved the idea. Instead, the director asked Cornfield to find a script he could direct and the beautifully touching The Elephant Man (1980) was the resulting production. Later, Lynch returned to Ronnie Rocket in the early 90s, when he pitched the idea to French Production Company CIBY-2000 as one feature in a three-picture deal. The company passed on the project and Lynch went on to film a feature based on his television series Twin Peaks entitled Fire Walk With Me and another movie, Lost Highway. Ronnie Rocket has since returned to the shelf, but Lynch never refers to it as dead, simply in hibernation. Ann Kroeber, the late wife of Lynch's sound designer Alan Splet has suggested that Ronnie Rocket has failed to be made not due to any production company's lack of interest in the project, but because Lynch is unwilling. Either way, it seems that Ronnie Rocket is not likely to launch any time soon... But, for those desperate to know more, a variety of scripts for the film float around the internet and are available for a leisurely peruse or to download. 06. TERRY GILLIAM'S THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE In the first of two adaptations of the Miguel de Cervantes novel that failed to materialise, surrealist director Terry Gilliam had designs to bring his adaptation to the screen in the early 2000s. Casting Jean Rochefort in the lead role, a number of problems quickly arose to throw production off kilter: Rochefort was discovered to have a back problem that meant he winced in pain every time he rode a horse (which was a lot!) and a flash flood destroyed sets, locations (including the colour of the landscape) and equipment in Spain, which rendered the previous footage redundant. The relatively small budget was quickly exasperated and very little useable footage was available to show for the time and money spent on shooting. Subsequently the production was shut down. Along the road to getting the film back into production a number of names have been attached to appear in various roles, including Johnny Depp in a supporting role, Vanessa Paradis as the love interest, as well as Gerard Depardieu and Michael Palin as replacements for Rochefort. Finally, pre-production reportedly restarted in 2008 -- after a lengthy legal rights battle between the projects French producers and German insurers was finally resolved -- with Robert Duvall and Ewan McGregor attached to star. However, yet again funding fell through and by September 2010 the project was shelved yet again. Unfortunately, it seems that the man who killed Don Quixote may just have killed him for the last time. However, Gilliam forever lives in hope that he will be able to complete the film, but until that time we have the excellent documentary Lost in La Mancha (2002) to enjoy, which chronicles the director's original doomed attempt to bring this epic tale to the screen. 05. FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA'S MEGALOPOLIS Megalopolis -- a science fiction tale of epic proportions -- has been described by director Francis Ford Coppola as a highly personal film. He has claimed that his major studio productions from the 90s -- Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Jack (1996) and The Rainmaker (1997) -- were made to generate enough finance to get his pet obsession off the ground. So why, I hear you ask, with three financial hits did Megalopolis never come to fruition? Well, it came very close, with test shots produced in New York and meetings with potential actors progressing well. However, the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre happened soon after progress started to be made and this threw a spanner in Coppola's works. For a film that heavily featured an aspiration for a utopian NYC, it suddenly became impossible for the director to create such an impression. Coppola toiled with what direction to take the film in but ultimately found he couldn't achieve anything without finding himself forced to acknowledge the implications of one of America's greatest tragedies. "The setting is modern New York. It deals... with the idea that the future world we're going to live in is being negotiated today... It's kind of a shape-of-things-to-come film in which the characters are concerned with artists, businessmen, proletariat all having a stake in the future but very few of them having a hand in what it's going to be like. It's a little bit like an Ayn Rand novel." Megalopolis was subsequently shelved in 2007, with Coppola claiming to not have entirely turned his back on it. Whilst he hasn't ruled out returning to the idea he has yet to do so, instead making and releasing Youth Without Youth (2007) -- a romance story wrapped up in a medical fantasy/mystery -- Tetro (2009) -- a drama revolving around the relationship of two brothers -- and the upcoming Twixt Now and Sunrise (2011) -- a gothic film created out of an alcohol induced dream the director had in Turkey! The possibility of Megalopolis remains, but it seems that viewers will have to suffice with Coppola's other 'personal' projects, rather than his grand science fiction feature. 04. GEORGE CUKOR'S SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE Possibly one of the most famous unfinished pieces of cinema in Hollywood's history, Something's Got To Give re-teamed Marilyn Monroe with director George Cukor in an attempt to recreate the success of their previous collaboration, Let's Make Love (1960). Starring opposite Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse, Monroe played Ellen Arden -- a wife and mother of two who is legally declared dead after being lost at sea! -- in what was a remake of the earlier Cary Grant and Irene Dunne screwball comedy My Favourite Wife (1940). From the beginning of the shoot the production was plagued with problems. Monroe had recently undergone gallbladder surgery and called in sick with a severe sinus infection on the first day. The studio doctor suggested that production be halted for a month for the actress to fully recover. However, impatient, Cukor insisted on shooting scenes around Monroe and the following month continued as such, with the leading lady occasionally showing up for a few hours work. Shooting soon fell behind schedule and the production quickly went over budget. The unreliable nature of Monroe's health eventually forced 20th Century Fox to dismiss her from the project, in what was more likely an attempt to offset the escalating budget of the Taylor-Burton epic Cleopatra (1963), which was also in production at the time and wildly over budget. Actress Lee Remick was hired to replace Monroe, but Martin (who had leading lady approval) rejected the casting. In order to not make the whole escapade an entire waste of time, Fox finally relented and re-hired Monroe. Agreeing to give her more than her original $100000 fee (on the condition that she made a further 2 films for them), Fox agreed to replace Cukor with Jean Negulesco at the star's behest. Production was due to start again in October 1962, but before it could begin, Monroe's death that month finally halted production once and for all. What remains is approximately 40 minutes of footage that was assembled for the television documentary Marilyn: The Final Days (2001), which reveals how wonderful the film really would have been if completed. 03. ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S KALEIDOSCOPE (A.K.A FRENZY) The post-Psycho 60s for Alfred Hitchcock were rather grim, with his films making very few waves or receiving little critical success. By the mid-60s, with both Marnie (1964) and Torn Curtain (1966) proving rather unpopular with critics and audiences alike, Hitch turned his attentions to a film as dark as Psycho in its narrative, but far more experimental in its technical aspects. Kaleidoscope (which the director also considered calling Frenzy -- not to be confused with his 1972 film of the same name though!) was to bring the story of a serial rapist and killer to the screen. Envisioned as an almost prelude to Hitch's earlier film Shadow of a Doubt (1946, which was also his favourite project) this would have been an extremely dark film that was shot entirely from the killer's perspective. Conceiving the murderer as a vulnerable but attractive young man (who was also a closeted homosexual) the director believed that the 'everyman' image of his antagonist might prove a prospect too frightening for audiences! Whilst Kaleidoscope appeared to be a thoroughly planned project, MCA Studios who were backing the production decided to pull out on the basis of the fact that the protagonist was too ugly! This proved a major gripe with Hitchcock for the rest of his life, however MCA's decision was probably influenced more by the high risk nature of the project and the potentially financial loss that could come with the director's new style (including the use of hand-held cameras and natural light, mimicking the European wave of cinema verite productions). All that remains of this fascinating production is an hour-long tape of silent, experimental footage that unfortunately pales in comparison to the thought of Kaleidoscope fully realised. 02. ORSON WELLES' DON QUIXOTE Similar to Alfred Hitchcock, when Orson Welles died a number of fantastic projects died with him. Leaving behind numerous unfinished films and production ideas from his 50 year career, Don Quixote remained the director's most passionate obsession throughout his life. Production actually began on Don Quixote in 1955 and cameras continued to roll over the subsequent decades in a variety of locations, including Mexico, Spain and Italy. Whenever Welles could generate the finance needed to shoot a little more, he would reassemble the cast and crew and capture another portion of the script. Due to the on/off nature of the production, both the script and style of the film was forced change countless times over the years. Over the decades, Welles undertook a number of projects he didn't have much of a vested interest in, in order to raise the funding he needed to complete Don Quixote. One such film that Welle's did want to make however, was his noir masterpiece Touch of Evil (1958). Using the money he received from this production he rushed back to Mexico to film more of Don Quixote. However, during his absence from Hollywood, Universal took it upon themselves to re-edit and butcher his dark film, fundamentally changing everything Welles had worked so hard to capture. Dejected by his lack of directorial control and appearing unable or unwilling to finish Don Quixote, Welles continued to direct feature films into the 1970s, but his output (excluding The Trial [1962]) failed to live up to his legend. Despite his disillusionment with the industry he had helped to shape, Don Quixote remained in Welles' mind and he continued to muse about completing the film right up to a few months before his death in 1985. At the end of his life, all that remained was 300000 feet of film footage that had been poorly organised and dispersed across the globe. In 1992, exploitation filmmaker Jess Franco gathered this together and produced an attrociously 'restored' version of the film, which was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. Offering only the odd glimpse of Welles' directorial brilliance and Francisco Reiguera's incredible performance as the eponymous hero, Franco's Don Quixote was a travesty that must have had Welles turning in his grave... 01. STANLEY KUBRICK'S NAPOLEON In 1968, Stanley Kubrick -- the director who was legendarily a perfectionist! -- began pre-production research on what would have been one of his most ambitious and personal projects of his carrer. Napoleon was to be an epic biopic of the legendary emperor, with Jack Nicholson playing the lead. Kubrick had a lifelong obsession with his Napoleon and the film was envisioned as a full and complete dramatisation of his life, including full-scale reconstructions of various battles that would employ in excess of 50000 extras! Kubrick spent two years meticulously researching historical facts for the film and immersed himself and his team in a complete examinantion of the Napoleonic era. Kubrick built a scrupulous day-by-day description of court life, which included an index of approximately 15000 images of the period. Ever the perfectionist, the director sought after specialist lenses that would enable him to film exteriors in the evening and even discovered a cheap paper fabric to be used for the soldiers' uniforms. In another attempt to keep costs down, Kubrick also obtained an agreement from the Romanian army to supply multiple thousands of soldiers for use in the epic battle scenes he planned to film. However, by 1969 the sheer magnitude of Kubric's grand production caused MGM to refuse to provide the exorbitant costs that the director had tried to keep at a minimum. Despite the enormous financial success of his previous film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), MGM simply refused to foot the bill for Kubrick's particularly indulgent project. Therefore, the director approached Warner Brothers to provide the funding instead. However, he again failed to spark enough interest in a project of Napoleon's size, but went on to make A Clockwork Orange (1971) instead. Kubrick never gave up hope for finding funding for his hiostorical epic, but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be. For those interested in finding out more about the production, a book that is of equal epic proportions is available ( but will set you back about 45! ) and is an equally meticulous chronicle of all of Kubrick's research. A cheaper option would probably be to check out my fellow OWF contributor Oliver Pfeiffer's fantastic 50 Reasons Why Stanley Kubrick is the Greatest Director of All Time ! Know of any other unrealised/unreleased projects that you wish had been completed or seen a release -- let us know by leaving a comment below! Item #3 of Kubrick's pitch to the studio for funding of Napoleon pretty much says it all: "It's impossible to tell you what I'm going to do except to say that I expect to make the best movie ever made" What about "Rendezvous with Rama" ? Does anybody know any news about this? As far as i know Morgan Freeman wanted (i think he still wants) to make it alive more than 10 years ago already and also to take lead role in film and and and also wanted to David Fincher to direct it, bet he refused because of non-finished script or there wasn't any script at all or somethin' .. not sure actually. Despite the thing that Fincher said that the project is dead, it's still floating in the air and i think we just missing this Sci-Fi project as well. This could be number 11 :) Anyway book is just fantastic, one of my favorites! Hard to imagine that on the big screen and if Fincher would ever direct it.. huh.. that's sounds just too good. I totally agree, Dune would fit perfectly in this list... I mean, com on : Alejandro Jodorowsky, H.R. Gieger, Salvador Dali, Moebius, Pink Floy, Tangerine Dream ALTOGETHER ! This is probably the best movie that never existed... * -- "Kingdom of the Sun" (which eventually transformed into "The Emporer's New Groove") * -- "Wild Life" (A Disney film set in 1970?s New York City. That would have certainly been something.) * -- The Pixar version of "The Brave Little Toaster" * -- Don Bluth's "SatyrDay" and "Song of the Whales" * -- "Who Discovered Roger Rabbit" * -- And rising above them all, Walt Disney's original plans for "Fantasia". Before the "Fantasia" we know imploded at the box office, Disney had a ton of crazy plans for it. He wanted to keep it "on tour" forever, and periodically release new versions of the film with old musical numbers swapped in for new ones with all-new animation. Considering that Walt Disney was basically the James Cameron of his day (ambitious and kind of insane, making up new technology on the spot just to pull off one special effect perfectly), the "Fantasia" "remixes" could have changed the course of the history of western animation. But you are wrong -- Lovecraft's At The Mountains Of Madness is still going to be a realised feature film! While Del Toro and Cameron are gone from At The Mountains Of Madness -- Mihai and Sparks are in!! Directing-Producing team Shadow Mihai and Carrie Cain Sparks have announced they are in early pre-production on an original feature film adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's At The Mountains Of Madness, which they will shoot live action in the 3D format. In early anticipation of the film, they this week released the sjLume.com audio book version of At The Mountains Of Madness along with a companion e-book version in various electronic formats. All of us Lovecraft fans and horror fans, and fans of 3D film were let down when Del Toro dropped At The Mountains Of Madness. But Mihai and Sparks intend to produce a film with similar production values out of their own company, Stella James Studios. A start date for the historic film is supposed to be announced this week on sjlume.com This article was pretty neat and I was screaming to myself the entire time that Napoleon had better be number one. That said, the article abuses the exclamation point at every opportunity and gave me quite a few laughs. Maybe take a breath and don't be so excited next time, eh? Chris Cunningham's adaptation of 'Necromancer' (or ANY feature from him) has to be on the list. AND whilst we're talking about Napoleon/Kubrick/CUnningham -- surely AI should be at #1. Oh, sorry, you're ALL wrong. Top of the heap of 'unfinished projects', without equal, is Eisenstein's 'Que Viva Mexico'. Amateurs discussing auteurs. p.s. 'Kaleidoscope', in concept, always seemed like a lazy version of 'Peeping Tom' to me (as was 'Psycho'). Hitchcock never had a writer of Pressburger's intellect and wit on board.
IN	The publisher of one recent teen book has focused its marketing on the book's first sentence, quoting Frank Cottrell-Boyce, author of Millions : "One of the best first sentences I've ever read and a book that lives up to it!" Here is that first sentence: "The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs don't got nothing much to say. About anything." The dog's first sentence in the book is: "Need a poo, Todd." Want to know more? Read the book , The Knife of Never Letting Go , by Patrick Ness. I found the book, a deeply philosophical action-packed science fiction thriller, excellent, in a nail-biting sort of way, and think it would be a popular addition to secondary libraries. This year's Newbery Award winning book existed for many years as a first sentence only. To quote the author: I had a notebook with the words, "There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife." That was definitely going to be the first line. I had begun and given up on the opening many times, and suddenly I thought, I can start in the middle. So I did. So what do you think makes a great first sentence in a book? Maybe you could hold a competition with students and teachers putting forward their favourites. Perhaps your students could devise their own great first sentences. As always, we would be very excited to hear about your ideas in the comments below.
OP ob	Ok, to be honest, we will all make mistakes in this space. The real issue here is that Beth Brody and Brody PR completely missed an opportunity to throw herself into the conversation. This didn't have to go nuclear -- one of the most common comments is reflected in Jennifer Leggio's opening, "I try to be supportive of the public relations industry." I guarantee you that if Ms. Brody, or one of her staff, were to jump in and beg forgiveness and really address all of the issues of each "reply all" recipient, then this would not have ended up in ZDNet and AdAge -- in fact, there were many warnings early on in the Reply All fiasco when folks were begging and pleading for someone -- anyone -- to jump in and control air traffic! There was too much time -- hours -- between the initial mess-up and the stove-piping from email to Twitter and then tothe blogs of the crme de la crme of marketing, PR, advertising, social media bloggers and -- wait for it -- journalists! There is a very valuable lesson here for one and for all. On the surface, it seems like the A-lister email blast and the open CC were the kill shots, but they were just contributing factors. Beth Brody and Brody PR, your error was in the realm of crisis management and a failure to respond. The message -- and mistake -- got away from you. It happens. But it is completely unacceptable not to cowboy up and throw yourself onto the grenade and practice a little mea maxima culpa marketing . Update from Beth Brody -- Via Email at 5:52PM: Dear Chris, I wanted to explain what happened today and apologize. I created a list of social media experts who might be interested in reviewing a new guide to social media for small biz. I inadvertently put the list name in the cc: box, rather than the bcc: box. A few folks must have hit the "reply all" button, rather than clicking on the "unsubscribe link" at the bottom, which started a stream of spam. Please accept my personal apology, albeit a little late in the day, since I was trying to remove everyone who wanted to be unsubscribed from the list immediately. I have deleted the offending list. Please let me know if you have any more questions about my mistake. Regards, Beth Chris Abraham is a partner in Socialmedia.biz and heads up special projects for Reputation.com . Contact Chris via email , follow him on Twitter and Google Plus or leave a comment below. Sad that companies such brody pr even play in this space. Strikes me as someone in their kitchen, pc on top of PR for dummies books trying to figure out how to email those who didn't request it. The bar is set way too low for PR firms. Most don't have a clue. I have to admit. I was on the list and yes Beth made a mistake however, who are these A list bloggers and journalists that can't figure out not to hit reply-all? Anyone who knows how to write an email knows how to reply and reply all. And after the many people replying-all to other people's pleas to stop replying all it because a mess. Hey Chris: I think the real story was the obnoxious behavior of everyone else on the list. While Beth Brody made a mistake, everyone who hit Reply to All and wrote obnoxious blog posts (which yours is not) consciously knew what they were doing. It was very rude and mean spirited. I don't think many of these people would have done it to her face. You are right that she had an opportunity to stop the anger if she just came out publicly quickly to apologize which she did eventually. Read my take on the whole case: Social media "gurus" and bloggers are egotistical jerks http://www.sparkminute.com/?p=915 Funny how Brody PR has done exactly what all the so-called A-listers and social media "experts" say they should do -- cry "mea culpa!" and apologize -- and yet are not getting any sort of "Good for them for apologizing" kind of messaging. I guess it's far easier to be snarky and cackle over someone's honest mistake instead of being a decent human being and saying, "Good for you for correcting the problem." Remind me who is calling the pot and kettle black again? Disclaimer: I work for Empower MediaMarketing and this is my own opinion. Just to be clear, the names of people on the email list were NEVER revealed unless they chose to reply all, in which case it was obvious that they'd received the email (unless you've found some way to "hack" it?) The email address of the mailing list itself was all that was revealed, and whilst it should have been (a) hidden and (b) restricted, email addresses on the list weren't compromised if no action was taken by any individual. I'm not defending the action, but believe me it's very obvious when someone sends to everyone in the To: or Cc: fields -- this wasn't the case here. Oh, please. Stop vilifying Beth Brody. She made a mistake with the CC vs. BCC field. OK, I get that. It wasn't intentional, obviously, since Beth would know the ramifications. That they are calling her press release "spam" is absurd. She's just promoting some book. She made up a mailing list, and sent the release. Come on, get real. That's what delete key is for. This wasn't a Nigerian 419 get-rich mailing scam. No sales of Viagra or Vailum or a master's degree for $100. Plus no one is faulting the recipients who are mistakenly hitting Reply All. And if auto-responders are doing this, fire the tech wizard who set up your email servers. Auto-responders should go back to the sender only, NOT the CC list. It amazes me how people still have this prima donna attitude about getting pitched, and worse, how they think their email addresses are sacred. The promoters offering acai berries, Rolex watches and security alert logins for your bank accounts are the ones to be vilified. Instead, we go after Brody, the low-hanging fruit. Trash her business and spam her clients with hate mail. Welcome to new media. An apology from Brody PR - I created a list of social media experts who might be interested in reviewing a new guide to social media for small biz. I inadvertently put the list name in the cc: box, rather than the bcc: box. A few folks must have hit the "reply all" button, rather than clicking on the "unsubscribe link" at the bottom, which started a stream of spam. Please accept my personal apology, albeit a little late in the day, since I was trying to remove everyone who wanted to be unsubscribed from the list immediately.
NA ne	Speaking in a lecture called Happy and Healthy Ageing: Paradox or Possibility?, he said: "I think there is real hope we can extend human life by some decades further. But the aim is not just to eke out extra existence but to facilitate a longer healthy life. We just don't want to live longer, we want to live longer well. And these drugs will help with regeneration processes in the body, so people will live well, much longer." Prof Smith, dean of medicine at New South Wales University, revealed exciting therapies are in the early stages of development which could be on the market in five years. One of these is an anti-ageing compound found in red wine called resveratrol which is being studied by Harvard University's Prof David Sinclair. He declared: "We're seeing the beginning of technology that could one day allow us to reach 150." But Prof Smith warned a big increase in much older people will make tackling dementia a priority to prevent "catastrophic" effects on the economy.
ID	I have a cat named Sammy that does NOTHING but MEOW ALL THE TIME! It is very irritating because it seems as though he has no reason to meow. He is very well cared for--has plenty of food and water, gets a good amount of attention (petting and playing), etc. It often keeps me up at night or wakes me up too early in the morning, and I wasn't expecting that from a cat. My parents have had a few cats and none of them have been even nearly this loud. I've tried squirting him every time he meows for a few weeks now and he just doesn't get it (this was a suggestion on another webpage)--I've tried ignoring him and that doesn't work because he just keeps meowing. It's like he's a compulsive meower and even does it while he's eating or cleaning himself! I love the cat but he needs to learn how to quiet down! Has he done this since he was a kitten? How long has it been since his last vet visit? It could be that he doesn't feel well and is sort of "needy feeling" Does he also follow you around and seem restless? Hyperthyroid, diabetes to name a couple may cause him to be hyper. If he is not sick it could even be his diet, not enough or an imbalance of nutrients can leave some cats feeling very unsatisfied which can lead to odd behaviour. Do be sure to check as many health causes before starting with training. It would be sad to squirt him with water if he wasn't well! I'd be very concerned if he is meowing non-stop. __________________ I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. ~Voltaire Thanks Maya...I'm making an appt to have him checked out next week. The idea that he might not be feeling well never occurred to me and that wouldn't be nice to be squirting him with water if that's the case. I have refrained from that lately since it doesn't seem to be doing anything. If he isn't sick I'll try out the new diet. He may just need more play time. I live alone and he is a very social cat. Thank you for the suggestions! Once you rule out a potential health issue at the vets, perhaps it's time to consider getting a 2nd cat? I know there are others here on this board who advocate having 2 cats as they tend to amuse each other and don't always turn to you 24/7 for mental stimulation. Most folks will tell you it's not much more difficult to have 2 than one, personally, I have 2 dogs and although they still require a good deal of attention from me, they do keep each other occupied when I'm not home. Just a thought, good luck with your lil guy and I hope everything works out for you __________________ "Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you" Ralph Waldo Emerson it could be a health issue, it could also be emotional discomfort as well. When I adopted my Peanut from the spca, she was REALLY vocal. She used to meow all the time. She doesn't meow now as much, unless you go talk to her or unless she's in teh bathroom doing her daily routine of 5 second meowing with her imaginary friend in the bathroom. I don't know why she only meows in there. So i think that she used to be so vocal because of the changes in her life from her home, then to spca, then to my home with a new resident animal. Maybe your cat is experiencing stress as well, or maybe he's lonely, but some cats are generally vocal, so before you run and get another cat, consider the fact that he may not get over the meowing just because there's another animal. Raeday06, You are so totally welcome! I hope all goes well at the vet. The food forum here is a good place to look for information on what's healthiest and what to feed senior's or younger cats etc.. if you decide to switch, like i'm not sure if you know this but Iams is really unhealthy and can cause urinary blockage, so you need to be careful what you decide to switch to and how fast. It would need to be a gradual switch or they can get sick. I used vet food for a long time as well and later found out that it wasn't so hot either. Mine was a big time MEOWer also, very loving and expressive and like that even when he had his brother with him. He wasn't a non-stop meower though, I think that is unusual. Sometimes to quiet him down I gave him catnip toys with GOOD QUALITY health food store catnip which kept him busy because he'd put that in his mouth and slobber for a while!!! You could try keeping a supply on hand to give him if he wakes you up or you are busy. It's also possible he does just need a lot of attention, a friend or even a better view that includes some birds to watch! Good luck. __________________ I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. ~Voltaire It's like he's a compulsive meower and even does it while he's eating or cleaning himself! He may just be very neurotic. In this case, squirting him with water is only going to make it worse (or as you said, at least no better), because it will only give him something else to worry about. It could also be an uncontrollable behavior - kind of like tourettes in humans maybe? Maybe there's just nothing he can do to stop himself from meowing. It's unusual for a cat to meow constantly, and not even stop while cleaning himself or eating, and the only time I've seen similar behavior is either when a female cat is in heat (and even then they stop when they're eating usually), or when there's some kind of mental problem. It's not unusual for a cat to meow a lot after bringing it into your home, but your cats behavior goes WAY past normal, so I think it has to be either a physical or mental health issue, not a behavioral one. She doesn't meow now as much, unless you go talk to her or unless she's in teh bathroom doing her daily routine of 5 second meowing with her imaginary friend in the bathroom. I don't know why she only meows in there. That's really funny, does she look in the mirror while she is doing this? Max does this as well, but he does it so that someone will turn on the bathroom faucet for him I agree with the others, though, a second cat often does wonders, without adding any extra work. Cats can often get stressed too, as has been pointed out, so it may be that as well.
OP ob	Who Do You Think You Are? Over the past few weeks, I've been feeling overwhelmed by messages about social media, and how best to market business online. I, like many of you, read and reread the same articles, opinions, and blogs, looking for some nugget of truth or wisdom, but in reality I just haven't found what I'm looking for. I'm told to be authentic, but to keep my writing short and to the point. What if I like big words? Should I skip the authenticity, and take things down a notch? I'm told to be real, but then I'm given lessons in small talk. How real is that? What if I just enjoy talking to people? Does it matter if you know who you are online? Yes, but not for the reasons many people might be telling you. It matters not so much to stake a claim on a few pixels of space, or to gain the title of "expert." You need to know who you are to be effective. The truth of the matter is that, as Seth Godin says it, "All marketers are liars." I don't care if you're selling a product, service, or by way of saying you're "real and genuine" or you're "building community," you're trying to make money. You're selling something. That's OK, a lot of people are doing it really well , and I benefit -- you benefit. What turns me off is when I realize I've been daft to listen. We talk about "content" but don't challenge each other to think. So the challenge I give to you (and myself) today is this: Define your own voice, and speak from it. Be OK with the fact that it will grow and change over time. Understand that some people will like it, others won't. Overall, keep learning; keep experimenting. Eventually you'll have a stage -- you'll have an audience. The best part is they'll be yours, or your brand's, not someone else's. If you need some inspiration, take a look at Lauren Luke , a single mum from England with "not many mates, and not much confidence" who's found her voice on YouTube, and as a result of being real, an audience of millions.

NA nb	It's 'on the wagon' time for me! This may come as a surprise for many of you, but I have decided to seek professional help. I'm going on the wagon. I am officially entering "political" detox. It's rehab for me. I think there are about 48 percent of Americans who might need the same kind of treatment. I decided to call a doctor. Even though I don't know any psychiatrists, I figured to get the best help I could. Since he has not been so busy for many years due to the death of his most famous patient, I called Dr. Vinnie BoomBatz, the former medical genius who had helped Rodney Dangerfield feel better about himself after getting no respect. Dr. Vinnie is not a Doctor of Psychology or Psychiatry, but he did have a sign on the wall of his office that read "Don't Worry! I Stayed in a Holiday Inn Express." I knew I was at the right office when, while waiting, General David Petraeus came out after the seeing the doctor and seemed to be laughing. "Next," Dr. Vinnie boomed! "Mr. Lynn Roberts." "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Roberts?" the good doctor asked. I began to explain that since last Wednesday I had been seeing visions of Karl Rove's white board as I slept. I told the doctor that Rove seemed to be talking about Ohio and how the southern tip of Hamilton County had multiplied into millions of Republican votes while Cleveland was due a lake-effect snowstorm off Lake Erie. As a result, the President would get 3.2 percent fewer votes than in 2008 and Romney would whup up on him in the great state of Ohio. Dr. BoomBatz began to caress his chin and surmise. "I see," he ventured. "You seem to have a very serious case of Fantastical Presidential Elect-ilitus. You would not believe the number of cases I have seen this week. Tell me something about your daily schedule." "Well, Doc, I wake up at about 5:00 in the morning. I turn my Joe DiMaggio Mr. Coffee Machine on, along with my laptop computer with the homepage of 'Real Clear Politics.' As my coffee makes, I read columns by Charles Krauthammer and Dick Morris. Dr. BoomBatz was not even taking notes. He had heard this before. "After a few columns, I turn on the television to "Way Too Early" with Willie Geist. After Willie, there is Morning Joe and Fox and Friends. I watch those programs for a while then switch to radio. There is Glenn Beck, Laura Ingraham, and Rush Limbaugh." I continued, "After Rush rants and raves for a few hours, I go back to television and it is switching back and forth between Fox and MSNBC. It all came to a head last Tuesday and I have had trouble sleeping ever since. What can I do?" "No worries," he said. "I'll write you a prescription that should work." I looked at the prescription. It read: "Rip Van Winkle Pills (Good for four years of sleep)."
NA ne	York takes new path in mental health for students York University is flipping its intervention strategy by positioning student leaders as their first line of defence in getting people help. "We want to provide upstream prevention," said Leah State , the university's health educator and co-organizer of York's newest campaign. The two-week event kicked off Wednesday with a conference attended by more than 200 students active in the York community. State said she hopes the conference taught them how to raise awareness about mental health issues on campus and where to direct those in need. "We need to invest in these students who are a link in the chain. The students are not there to solve all the problems," she said. "But the students are a key link in that chain." That is because it is most likely that distressed students will reach out to their peers first, said State, as reported by Metro news Nov. 4. Read full story . Autism research chair will look at bullying A Toronto researcher has been awarded a $2-million chair in autism research to address the lopsided rates of mental health problems among children and adults with autism, including the effects of bullying. Jonathan Weiss , a professor in York's department of psychology, has been awarded the new five-year research chair position, funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, reported the Toronto Star Nov. 4. "Targeting mental health means being able to help with a person's quality of life," said Weiss, 35. He noted that between 40 and 70 per cent of those with autism are also grappling with mental health issues, on top of living with a developmental disorder that affects social interactions and communication, among other traits. "What we aim to do is first focus on understanding why those rates are so high. What are the risk factors?" Weiss asked. Read full story . Spy versus CI Andrew Crane , a business ethics professor at the York's Schulich School of Business in Toronto, says few business schools deal with intelligence gathering, because it's not one of the major issues on the radar. "We're not always necessarily preparing our students that well," reported The Globe and Mail Nov. 5. Read full story . Global business programs have students living out of suitcases York University's Schulich School of Business, the Toronto institution which pioneered the international MBA in Canada 20 years ago, is constantly evolving to keep pace with the growing demand for business school graduates who can operate in a global context, IMBA director Atipol Bhanich Supapol says. Schulich requires IMBA applicants to demonstrate strong functional proficiency in a second language -- testing at the intermediate level as a minimum -- with the condition that those who are not up to snuff will bolster those skills during their studies, reported The globe and Mail Nov. 2. Read full story . In hard times, soft skills more in need Business ethics have also experienced a revival since the economic crisis. And while it's an element of business education that has been around for years, such events as the Enron scandal and the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme have brought this discipline to the forefront. "Scandals are good for business when it comes to business ethics," explains Andrew Crane , director of the Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business at York's Schulich School of Business in Toronto. And thanks to scandals and the economic meltdown, even the fight to get ethics onto the syllabus has changed, he explains. "A number of years ago it was something that we had to make more of argument to have included on the curriculum or we had to convince students of the necessity of it," Dr. Crane says. "The last few years that's very much not the case," reported The Globe and Mail Nov. 5. Read full story .
